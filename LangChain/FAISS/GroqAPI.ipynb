With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure\\nin the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's\\nmethodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can\\nsignificantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.The Docker platformDocker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated\\nenvironment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many\\ncontainers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain\\neverything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's\\ninstalled on the host. You can share containers while you work,\\nand be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the\\nsame way.Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment,\\nas a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your\\nproduction environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid\\nof the two.What can I use Docker for?Fast, consistent delivery of your applicationsDocker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in\\nstandardized environments using local containers which provide your applications\\nand services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous\\ndelivery (CI/CD) workflows.Consider the following example scenario:Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues\\nusing Docker containers.They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and run\\nautomated and manual tests.When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment\\nand redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as\\npushing the updated image to the production environment.Responsive deployment and scalingDocker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker\\ncontainers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual\\nmachines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically\\nmanage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as\\nbusiness needs dictate, in near real time.Running more workloads on the same hardwareDocker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative\\nto hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your server\\ncapacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density\\nenvironments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with\\nfewer resources.Docker architectureDocker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the\\nDocker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and\\ndistributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can\\nrun on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker\\ndaemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX\\nsockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose,\\nthat lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.\\nThe Docker daemonThe Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker\\nobjects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also\\ncommunicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.The Docker clientThe Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact\\nwith Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these\\ncommands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the\\nDocker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.Docker DesktopDocker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see\\nDocker Desktop.Docker registriesA Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public\\nregistry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on\\nDocker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, Docker pushes\\nyour image to your configured registry.Docker objectsWhen you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks,\\nvolumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some\\nof those objects.ImagesAn image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker\\ncontainer. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional\\ncustomization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu\\nimage, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the\\nconfiguration details needed to make your application run.You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others\\nand published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile\\nwith a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run\\nit. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you\\nchange the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have\\nchanged are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small,\\nand fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.ContainersA container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop,\\nmove, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a\\ncontainer to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new\\nimage based on its current state.By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and\\nits host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage,\\nor other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host\\nmachine.A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you\\nprovide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to\\nits state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear.Example docker run commandThe following command runs an ubuntu container, attaches interactively to your\\nlocal command-line session, and runs /bin/bash.\\n\\n$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash\\nWhen you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using\\nthe default registry configuration):If you don't have the ubuntu image locally, Docker pulls it from your\\nconfigured registry, as though you had run docker pull ubuntu manually.Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a docker container create\\ncommand manually.Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final\\nlayer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and\\ndirectories in its local filesystem.Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default\\nnetwork, since you didn't specify any networking options. This includes\\nassigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can\\nconnect to external networks using the host machine's network connection.Docker starts the container and executes /bin/bash. Because the container\\nis running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the -i and -t\\nflags), you can provide input using your keyboard while Docker logs the output to\\nyour terminal.When you run exit to terminate the /bin/bash command, the container\\nstops but isn't removed. You can start it again or remove it.The underlying technologyDocker is written in the\\nGo programming language and takes\\nadvantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality.\\nDocker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace\\ncalled the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of\\nnamespaces for that container.These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs\\nin a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.Next stepsInstall DockerGet started with DockerPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsThe Docker platformWhat can I use Docker for?Fast, consistent delivery of your applicationsResponsive deployment and scalingRunning more workloads on the same hardwareDocker architectureThe Docker daemonThe Docker clientDocker DesktopDocker registriesDocker objectsThe underlying technologyNext steps\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/'}, page_content=''), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/'}, page_content=\"Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nIntroduction\\n/\\nGet Docker DesktopGet Docker DesktopTable of contentsExplanationTry it outRun your first containerAccess the frontendManage containers using Docker DesktopWhat's next?ExplanationDocker Desktop is the all-in-one package to build images, run containers, and so much more.\\nThis guide will walk you through the installation process, enabling you to experience Docker Desktop firsthand.Docker Desktop termsCommercial use of Docker Desktop in larger enterprises (more than 250\\nemployees OR more than $10 million USD in annual revenue) requires a\\npaid subscription.Docker Desktop for MacDownload (Apple Silicon) |\\nDownload (Intel) |\\nInstall instructionsDocker Desktop for WindowsDownload |\\nInstall instructionsDocker Desktop for LinuxInstall instructionsOnce it's installed, complete the setup process and you're all set to run a Docker container.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you will see how to run a Docker container using Docker Desktop.Follow the instructions to run a container using the CLI.Run your first containerOpen your CLI terminal and start a container by running the docker run command:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker\\nAccess the frontendFor this container, the frontend is accessible on port 8080.

Specifically, you will do the following:Clone and start a development projectMake changes to the backend and frontendSee the changes immediatelyTry it outIn this hands-on guide, you\\'ll learn how to develop with containers.Start the projectTo get started, either clone or\\ndownload the project as a ZIP file to your local machine.\\n\\n$ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app\\nAnd after the project is cloned, navigate into the new directory created by the clone:\\n\\n$ cd getting-started-todo-app\\nOnce you have the project, start the development environment using Docker Compose.To start the project using the CLI, run the following command:\\n\\n$ docker compose watch\\nYou will see an output that shows container images being pulled down, containers starting, and more. Don\\'t worry if you don\\'t understand it all at this point. But, within a moment or two, things should stabilize and finish.Open your browser to\\nhttp://localhost to see the application up and running. It may take a few minutes for the app to run. The app is a simple to-do application, so feel free to add an item or two, mark some as done, or even delete an item.\\nWhat\\'s in the environment?Now that the environment is up and running, what\\'s actually in it? At a high-level, there are several containers (or processes) that each serve a specific need for the application:React frontend - a Node container that\\'s running the React dev server, using\\nVite.Node backend - the backend provides an API that provides the ability to retrieve, create, and delete to-do items.MySQL database - a database to store the list of the items.phpMyAdmin - a web-based interface to interact with the database that is accessible at\\nhttp://db.localhost.Traefik proxy -\\nTraefik is an application proxy that routes requests to the right service. It sends all requests for localhost/api/* to the backend, requests for localhost/* to the frontend, and then requests for db.localhost to phpMyAdmin. This provides the ability to access all applications using port 80 (instead of different ports for each service).With this environment, you as the developer don’t need to install or configure any services, populate a database schema, configure database credentials, or anything. You only need Docker Desktop. The rest just works.Make changes to the appWith this environment up and running, you’re ready to make a few changes to the application and see how Docker helps provide a fast feedback loop.Change the greetingThe greeting at the top of the page is populated by an API call at /api/greeting. Currently, it always returns \"Hello world!\". You’ll now modify it to return one of three randomized messages (that you\\'ll get to choose).Open the backend/src/routes/getGreeting.js file in a text editor. This file provides the handler for the API endpoint.Modify the variable at the top to an array of greetings. Feel free to use the following modifications or customize it to your own liking. Also, update the endpoint to send a random greeting from this list.\\n\\n 1\\n 2\\n 3\\n 4\\n 5\\n 6\\n 7\\n 8\\n 9\\n10\\n11\\nconst GREETINGS = [\\n    \"Whalecome!\",\\n    \"All hands on deck!\",\\n    \"Charting the course ahead!\",\\n];\\n\\nmodule.exports = async (req, res) => {\\n    res.send({\\n        greeting: GREETINGS[ Math.floor( Math.random() * GREETINGS.length )],\\n    });\\n};If you haven\\'t done so yet, save the file. If you refresh your browser, you should see a new greeting. If you keep refreshing, you should see all of the messages appear.\\nChange the placeholder textWhen you look at the app, you\\'ll see the placeholder text is simply \"New Item\". You’ll now make that a little more descriptive and fun. You’ll also make a few changes to the styling of the app too.Open the client/src/components/AddNewItemForm.jsx file. This provides the component to add a new item to the to-do list.Modify the placeholder attribute of the Form.Control element to whatever you\\'d like to display.\\n\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n<Form.Control\\n    value={newItem}\\n    onChange={(e) => setNewItem(e.target.value)}\\n    type=\"text\"\\n    placeholder=\"What do you need to do?\"\\n    aria-label=\"New item\"\\n/>Save the file and go back to your browser. You should see the change already hot-reloaded into your browser. If you don\\'t like it, feel free to tweak it until it looks just right.\\nChange the background colorBefore you consider the application finalized, you need to make the colors better.Open the client/src/index.scss file.Adjust the background-color attribute to any color you\\'d like. The provided snippet is a soft blue to go along with Docker\\'s nautical theme.If you\\'re using an IDE, you can pick a color using the integrated color pickers. Otherwise, feel free to use an online\\nColor Picker.\\n\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\nbody {\\n    background-color: #99bbff;\\n    margin-top: 50px;\\n    font-family: \\'Lato\\';\\n}Each save should let you see the change immediately in the browser. Keep adjusting it until it\\'s the perfect setup for you.\\nAnd with that, you\\'re done. Congrats on updating your website.RecapBefore you move on, take a moment and reflect on what happened here. Within a few moments, you were able to:Start a complete development project with zero installation effort. The containerized environment provided the development environment, ensuring you have everything you need. You didn\\'t have to install Node, MySQL, or any of the other dependencies directly on your machine. All you needed was Docker Desktop and a code editor.Make changes and see them immediately. This was made possible because 1) the processes running in each container are watching and responding to file changes and 2) the files are shared with the containerized environment.Docker Desktop enables all of this and so much more. Once you start thinking with containers, you can create almost any environment and easily share it with your team.Next stepsNow that the application has been updated, you’re ready to learn about packaging it as a container image and pushing it to a registry, specifically Docker Hub.Build and push your first imagePage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationTry it outStart the projectWhat\\'s in the environment?Make changes to the appChange the greetingChange the placeholder textChange the background colorRecapNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/'}, page_content=\"Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nIntroduction\\n/\\nBuild and push your first imageBuild and push your first imageTable of contentsExplanationContainer imagesDocker HubTry it outSign in with your Docker accountCreate an image repositoryBuild and push the imageRecapNext stepsExplanationNow that you've updated the\\nto-do list app, you’re ready to create a container image for the application and share it on Docker Hub. To do so, you will need to do the following:Sign in with your Docker accountCreate an image repository on Docker HubBuild the container imagePush the image to Docker HubBefore you dive into the hands-on guide, the following are a few core concepts that you should be aware of.Container imagesIf you’re new to container images, think of them as a standardized package that contains everything needed to run an application, including its files, configuration, and dependencies. These packages can then be distributed and shared with others.Docker HubTo share your Docker images, you need a place to store them. This is where registries come in. While there are many registries, Docker Hub is the default and go-to registry for images. Docker Hub provides both a place for you to store your own images and to find images from others to either run or use as the bases for your own images.In\\nDevelop with containers, you used the following images that came from Docker Hub, each of which are\\nDocker Official Images:node - provides a Node environment and is used as the base of your development efforts. This image is also used as the base for the final application image.mysql - provides a MySQL database to store the to-do list itemsphpmyadmin - provides phpMyAdmin, a web-based interface to the MySQL databasetraefik - provides Traefik, a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that routes requests to the appropriate container based on routing rulesExplore the full catalog of\\nDocker Official Images,\\nDocker Verified Publishers, and\\nDocker Sponsored Open Source Software images to see more of what there is to run and build on.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you'll learn how to sign in to Docker Hub and push images to Docker Hub repository.Sign in with your Docker accountTo push images to Docker Hub, you will need to sign in with a Docker account.Open the Docker Dashboard.Select Sign in at the top-right corner.If needed, create an account and then complete the sign-in flow.Once you're done, you should see the Sign in button turn into a profile picture.Create an image repositoryNow that you have an account, you can create an image repository. Just as a Git repository holds source code, an image repository stores container images.Go to\\nDocker Hub.Select Create repository.On the Create repository page, enter the following information:Repository name - getting-started-todo-appShort description - feel free to enter a description if you'd likeVisibility - select Public to allow others to pull your customized to-do appSelect Create to create the repository.Build and push the imageNow that you have a repository, you are ready to build and push your image. An important note is that the image you are building extends the Node image, meaning you don't need to install or configure Node, yarn, etc. You can simply focus on what makes your application unique.What is an image/Dockerfile?Without going too deep yet, think of a container image as a single package that contains\\neverything needed to run a process. In this case, it will contain a Node environment,\\nthe backend code, and the compiled React code.Any machine that runs a container using the image, will then be able to run the application as\\nit was built without needing anything else pre-installed on the machine.A Dockerfile is a text-based script that provides the instruction set on how to build\\nthe image. For this quick start, the repository already contains the Dockerfile.\\nCLI\\n\\n\\nVS CodeTo get started, either clone or\\ndownload the project as a ZIP file to your local machine.\\n\\n$ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app\\nAnd after the project is cloned, navigate into the new directory created by the clone:\\n\\n$ cd getting-started-todo-app\\nBuild the project by running the following command, swapping out DOCKER_USERNAME with your username.\\n\\n$ docker build -t <DOCKER_USERNAME>/getting-started-todo-app .\\nFor example, if your Docker username was mobydock, you would run the following:\\n\\n$ docker build -t mobydock/getting-started-todo-app .\\nTo verify the image exists locally, you can use the docker image ls command:\\n\\n$ docker image ls\\nYou will see output similar to the following:\\n\\nREPOSITORY                          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE\\nmobydock/getting-started-todo-app   latest    1543656c9290   2 minutes ago    1.12GB\\n...\\nTo push the image, use the docker push command. Be sure to replace DOCKER_USERNAME with your username:\\n\\n$ docker push <DOCKER_USERNAME>/getting-started-todo-app\\nDepending on your upload speeds, this may take a moment to push.Open Visual Studio Code. Ensure you have the Docker extension for VS Code installed from\\nExtension Marketplace.\\nIn the File menu, select Open Folder. Choose Clone Git Repository and paste this URL:\\nhttps://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app\\nRight-click the Dockerfile and select the Build Image... menu item.\\nIn the dialog that appears, enter a name of DOCKER_USERNAME/getting-started-todo-app, replacing DOCKER_USERNAME with your Docker username.After pressing Enter, you'll see a terminal appear where the build will occur. Once it's completed, feel free to close the terminal.Open the Docker Extension for VS Code by selecting the Docker logo in the left nav menu.Find the image you created. It'll have a name of docker.io/DOCKER_USERNAME/getting-started-todo-app.Expand the image to view the tags (or different versions) of the image. You should see a tag named latest, which is the default tag given to an image.Right-click on the latest item and select the Push... option.\\nPress Enter to confirm and then watch as your image is pushed to Docker Hub. Depending on your upload speeds, it might take a moment to push the image.Once the upload is finished, feel free to close the terminal.RecapBefore you move on, take a moment and reflect on what happened here. Within a few moments, you were able to build a container image that packages your application and push it to Docker Hub.Going forward, you’ll want to remember that:Docker Hub is the go-to registry for finding trusted content. Docker provides a collection of trusted content, composed of Docker Official Images, Docker Verified Publishers, and Docker Sponsored Open Source Software, to use directly or as bases for your own images.Docker Hub provides a marketplace to distribute your own applications. Anyone can create an account and distribute images. While you are publicly distributing the image you created, private repositories can ensure your images are accessible to only authorized users.Usage of other registriesWhile Docker Hub is the default registry, registries are standardized and made\\ninteroperable through the\\nOpen Container Initiative. This allows companies and\\norganizations to run their own private registries. Quite often, trusted content\\nis mirrored (or copied) from Docker Hub into these private registries.Next stepsNow that you’ve built an image, it's time to discuss why you as a developer should learn more about Docker and how it will help you in your day-to-day tasks.What's NextPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationContainer imagesDocker HubTry it outSign in with your Docker accountCreate an image repositoryBuild and push the imageRecapNext steps\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/whats-next/'}, page_content=\"Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nIntroduction\\n/\\nWhat's nextWhat's nextThe following sections provide step-by-step guides to help you understand core Docker concepts, building images, and running containers.The basicsGet started learning the core concepts of containers, images, registries, and Docker Compose.What is a container?Learn how to run your first container.What is an image?Learn the basics of image layers.What is a registry?Learn about container registries, explore their interoperability, and interact with registries.What is Docker Compose?Gain a better understanding of Docker Compose.Building imagesCraft optimized container images with Dockerfiles, build cache, and multi-stage builds.Understanding image layersLearn about the layers of container images.Writing a DockerfileLearn how to create an image using a Dockerfile.Build, tag and publish an imageLearn how to build, tag, and publish an image to Docker Hub or any other registry.Using the build cacheLearn about the build cache, what changes invalidate the cache, and how to effectively use the build cache.Multi-stage buildsGet a better understanding of multi-stage builds and their benefits.Running containersMaster essential techniques for exposing ports, overriding defaults, persisting data, sharing files, and managing multi-container applications.Publishing portsUnderstand the significance of publishing and exposing ports in Docker.Overriding container defaultsLearn how to override the container defaults using the docker run command.Persisting container dataLearn the significance of data persistence in Docker.Sharing local files with containersExplore the various storage options available in Docker and their common usage.Multi-container applicationsLearn the significance of multi-container applications and how they're different from single-container applications.Page options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changes\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nThe basics\\n/\\nWhat is a container?What is a container?Table of contentsExplanationContainers versus virtual machines (VMs)Try it outAdditional resourcesNext stepsExplanationImagine you\\'re developing a killer web app that has three main components - a React frontend, a Python API, and a PostgreSQL database. If you wanted to work on this project, you\\'d have to install Node, Python, and PostgreSQL.How do you make sure you have the same versions as the other developers on your team? Or your CI/CD system? Or what\\'s used in production?How do you ensure the version of Python (or Node or the database) your app needs isn\\'t affected by what\\'s already on your machine? How do you manage potential conflicts?Enter containers!What is a container? Simply put, containers are isolated processes for each of your app\\'s components. Each component - the frontend React app, the Python API engine, and the database - runs in its own isolated environment, completely isolated from everything else on your machine.Here\\'s what makes them awesome. Containers are:Self-contained. Each container has everything it needs to function with no reliance on any pre-installed dependencies on the host machine.Isolated. Since containers are run in isolation, they have minimal influence on the host and other containers, increasing the security of your applications.Independent. Each container is independently managed. Deleting one container won\\'t affect any others.Portable. Containers can run anywhere! The container that runs on your development machine will work the same way in a data center or anywhere in the cloud!Containers versus virtual machines (VMs)Without getting too deep, a VM is an entire operating system with its own kernel, hardware drivers, programs, and applications. Spinning up a VM only to isolate a single application is a lot of overhead.A container is simply an isolated process with all of the files it needs to run. If you run multiple containers, they all share the same kernel, allowing you to run more applications on less infrastructure.Using VMs and containers togetherQuite often, you will see containers and VMs used together. As an example, in a cloud environment, the provisioned machines are typically VMs. However, instead of provisioning one machine to run one application, a VM with a container runtime can run multiple containerized applications, increasing resource utilization and reducing costs.Try it outIn this hands-on, you will see how to run a Docker container using the Docker Desktop GUI.\\nUsing the GUI\\n\\n\\nUsing the CLIUse the following instructions to run a container.Open Docker Desktop and select the Search field on the top navigation bar.Specify welcome-to-docker in the search input and then select the Pull button.\\nOnce the image is successfully pulled, select the Run button.Expand the Optional settings.In the Container name, specify welcome-to-docker.In the Host port, specify 8080.\\nSelect Run to start your container.Congratulations!

How do you share those environments?That\\'s where container images come in. A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.For a\\nPostgreSQL image, that image will package the database binaries, config files, and other dependencies. For a Python web app, it\\'ll include the Python runtime, your app code, and all of its dependencies.There are two important principles of images:Images are immutable. Once an image is created, it can\\'t be modified. You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it.Container images are composed of layers. Each layer represents a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files.These two principles let you to extend or add to existing images. For example, if you are building a Python app, you can start from the\\nPython image and add additional layers to install your app\\'s dependencies and add your code. This lets you focus on your app, rather than Python itself.Finding imagesDocker Hub is the default global marketplace for storing and distributing images. It has over 100,000 images created by developers that you can run locally. You can search for Docker Hub images and run them directly from Docker Desktop.Docker Hub provides a variety of Docker-supported and endorsed images known as Docker Trusted Content. These provide fully managed services or great starters for your own images. These include:Docker Official Images - a curated set of Docker repositories, serve as the starting point for the majority of users, and are some of the most secure on Docker HubDocker Verified Publishers - high-quality images from commercial publishers verified by DockerDocker-Sponsored Open Source - images published and maintained by open-source projects sponsored by Docker through Docker\\'s open source programFor example,\\nRedis and\\nMemcached are a few popular ready-to-go Docker Official Images. You can download these images and have these services up and running in a matter of seconds. There are also base images, like the\\nNode.js Docker image, that you can use as a starting point and add your own files and configurations.Try it out\\nUsing the GUI\\n\\n\\nUsing the CLIIn this hands-on, you will learn how to search and pull a container image using the Docker Desktop GUI.Search for and download an imageOpen the Docker Desktop Dashboard and select the Images view in the left-hand navigation menu.\\nSelect the Search images to run button.

That's where the image registry comes in.An image registry is a centralized location for storing and sharing your container images. It can be either public or private.\\nDocker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use and is the default registry.While Docker Hub is a popular option, there are many other available container registries available today, including\\nAmazon Elastic Container Registry(ECR),\\nAzure Container Registry (ACR), and\\nGoogle Container Registry (GCR). You can even run your private registry on your local system or inside your organization. For example, Harbor, JFrog Artifactory, GitLab Container registry etc.Registry vs. repositoryWhile you're working with registries, you might hear the terms registry and repository as if they're interchangeable. Even though they're related, they're not quite the same thing.A registry is a centralized location that stores and manages container images, whereas a repository is a collection of related container images within a registry. Think of it as a folder where you organize your images based on projects. Each repository contains one or more container images.The following diagram shows the relationship between a registry, repositories, and images.IIIIImmmmmaaaaagggggeeeeeR::R:::eeRpppppppeorrorrrgsoosoooiijjijjjsteeteeetoccocccrrttrtttyy--y---aabbbA::B:::vvvvv12112.....00010\\nNoteYou can create one private repository and unlimited public repositories using the free version of Docker Hub.

But, now you\\'re wanting to do something more complicated - run databases, message queues, caches, or a variety of other services. Do you install everything in a single container? Run multiple containers? If you run multiple, how do you connect them all together?One best practice for containers is that each container should do one thing and do it well. While there are exceptions to this rule, avoid the tendency to have one container do multiple things.You can use multiple docker run commands to start multiple containers. But, you\\'ll soon realize you\\'ll need to manage networks, all of the flags needed to connect containers to those networks, and more. And when you\\'re done, cleanup is a little more complicated.With Docker Compose, you can define all of your containers and their configurations in a single YAML file. If you include this file in your code repository, anyone that clones your repository can get up and running with a single command.It\\'s important to understand that Compose is a declarative tool - you simply define it and go. You don\\'t always need to recreate everything from scratch. If you make a change, run docker compose up again and Compose will reconcile the changes in your file and apply them intelligently.Dockerfile versus Compose fileA Dockerfile provides instructions to build a container image while a Compose file defines your running containers. Quite often, a Compose file references a Dockerfile to build an image to use for a particular service.Try it outIn this hands-on, you will learn how to use a Docker Compose to run a multi-container application. You\\'ll use a simple to-do list app built with Node.js and MySQL as a database server.Start the applicationFollow the instructions to run the to-do list app on your system.Download and install Docker Desktop.Open a terminal and\\nclone this sample application.\\n\\ngit clone https://github.com/dockersamples/todo-list-app \\nNavigate into the todo-list-app directory:\\n\\ncd todo-list-app\\nInside this directory, you\\'ll find a file named compose.yaml. This YAML file is where all the magic happens! It defines all the services that make up your application, along with their configurations. Each service specifies its image, ports, volumes, networks, and any other settings necessary for its functionality. Take some time to explore the YAML file and familiarize yourself with its structure.Use the\\ndocker compose up command to start the application:\\n\\ndocker compose up -d --build\\nWhen you run this command, you should see an output like this:\\n\\n[+] Running 5/5\\n✔ app 3 layers [⣿⣿⣿]      0B/0B            Pulled          7.1s\\n  ✔ e6f4e57cc59e Download complete                          0.9s\\n  ✔ df998480d81d Download complete                          1.0s\\n  ✔ 31e174fedd23 Download complete                          2.5s\\n  ✔ 43c47a581c29 Download complete                          2.0s\\n[+] Running 4/4\\n  ⠸ Network todo-list-app_default           Created         0.3s\\n  ⠸ Volume \"todo-list-app_todo-mysql-data\"  Created         0.3s\\n  ✔ Container todo-list-app-app-1           Started         0.3s\\n  ✔ Container todo-list-app-mysql-1         Started         0.3s\\nA lot happened here!

Understanding the image layers\\nHave you ever wondered how images work? This guide will help you to\\nunderstand image layers - the fundamental building blocks of container\\nimages. You'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how layers are created,\\nstacked, and utilized to ensure efficient and optimized containers.Start2. Writing a Dockerfile\\nMastering Dockerfile practices is vital for leveraging container technology\\neffectively, enhancing application reliability and supporting DevOps and\\nCI/CD methodologies. In this guide, you’ll learn how to write a Dockerfile,\\nhow to define a base image and setup instructions, including software\\ninstallation and copying necessary files.Start3.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to create Docker\\nimages, how to tag those images with a unique identifier, and how to publish\\nyour image to a public registry.Start4. Using the build cache\\nUsing the build cache effectively allows you to achieve faster builds by\\nreusing results from previous builds and skipping unnecessary steps. To\\nmaximize cache usage and avoid resource-intensive and time-consuming\\nrebuilds, it's crucial to understand how cache invalidation works. In this\\nguide, you’ll learn how to use the Docker build cache efficiently for\\nstreamlined Docker image development and continuous integration workflows.Start5. Multi-stage builds\\nBy separating the build environment from the final runtime environment, you\\ncan significantly reduce the image size and attack surface. In this guide,\\nyou'll unlock the power of multi-stage builds to create lean and efficient\\nDocker images, essential for minimizing overhead and enhancing deployment in\\nproduction environments.Start\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/understanding-image-layers/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nBuilding images\\n/\\nUnderstanding the image layersUnderstanding the image layersTable of contentsExplanationImage layersStacking the layersTry it outCreate a base imageBuild an app imageAdditional resourcesNext stepsExplanationAs you learned in\\nWhat is an image?, container images are composed of layers. And each of these layers, once created, are immutable. But, what does that actually mean? And how are those layers used to create the filesystem a container can use?Image layersEach layer in an image contains a set of filesystem changes - additions, deletions, or modifications. Let’s look at a theoretical image:The first layer adds basic commands and a package manager, such as apt.The second layer installs a Python runtime and pip for dependency management.The third layer copies in an application’s specific requirements.txt file.The fourth layer installs that application’s specific dependencies.The fifth layer copies in the actual source code of the application.This example might look like:\\nThis is beneficial because it allows layers to be reused between images. For example, imagine you wanted to create another Python application. Due to layering, you can leverage the same Python base. This will make builds faster and reduce the amount of storage and bandwidth required to distribute the images. The image layering might look similar to the following:\\nLayers let you extend images of others by reusing their base layers, allowing you to add only the data that your application needs.Stacking the layersLayering is made possible by content-addressable storage and union filesystems. While this will get technical, here’s how it works:After each layer is downloaded, it is extracted into its own directory on the host filesystem.When you run a container from an image, a union filesystem is created where layers are stacked on top of each other, creating a new and unified view.When the container starts, its root directory is set to the location of this unified directory, using chroot.When the union filesystem is created, in addition to the image layers, a directory is created specifically for the running container. This allows the container to make filesystem changes while allowing the original image layers to remain untouched. This enables you to run multiple containers from the same underlying image.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you will create new image layers manually using the\\ndocker container commit command. Note that you’ll rarely create images this way, as you’ll normally\\nuse a Dockerfile. But, it makes it easier to understand how it’s all working.Create a base imageIn this first step, you will create your own base image that you will then use for the following steps.Download and install Docker Desktop.In a terminal, run the following command to start a new container:\\n\\n$ docker run --name=base-container -ti ubuntu\\nOnce the image has been downloaded and the container has started, you should see a new shell prompt. This is running inside your container. It will look similar to the following (the container ID will vary):\\n\\nroot@d8c5ca119fcd:/#\\nInside the container, run the following command to install Node.js:\\n\\n$ apt update && apt install -y nodejs\\nWhen this command runs, it downloads and installs Node inside the container. In the context of the union filesystem, these filesystem changes occur within the directory unique to this container.Validate if Node is installed by running the following command:\\n\\n$ node -e \\'console.log(\"Hello world!\")\\'\\nYou should then see a “Hello world!” appear in the console.Now that you have Node installed, you’re ready to save the changes you’ve made as a new image layer, from which you can start new containers or build new images. To do so, you will use the\\ndocker container commit command. Run the following command in a new terminal:\\n\\n$ docker container commit -m \"Add node\" base-container node-base\\nView the layers of your image using the docker image history command:\\n\\n$ docker image history node-base\\nYou will see output similar to the following:\\n\\nIMAGE          CREATED          CREATED BY                                      SIZE      COMMENT\\nd5c1fca2cdc4   10 seconds ago   /bin/bash                                       126MB     Add node\\n2b7cc08dcdbb   5 weeks ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD [\"/bin/bash\"]            0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:07cdbabf782942af0…   69.2MB\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop)  LABEL org.opencontainers.…   0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop)  LABEL org.opencontainers.…   0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ARG LAUNCHPAD_BUILD_ARCH     0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ARG RELEASE                  0B\\nNote the “Add node” comment on the top line. This layer contains the Node.js install you just made.To prove your image has Node installed, you can start a new container using this new image:\\n\\n$ docker run node-base node -e \"console.log(\\'Hello again\\')\"\\nWith that, you should get a “Hello again” output in the terminal, showing Node was installed and working.Now that you’re done creating your base image, you can remove that container:\\n\\n$ docker rm -f base-container\\nBase image definitionA base image is a foundation for building other images. It\\'s possible to use any images as a base image. However, some images are intentionally created as building blocks, providing a foundation or starting point for an application.In this example, you probably won’t deploy this node-base image, as it doesn’t actually do anything yet. But it’s a base you can use for other builds.Build an app imageNow that you have a base image, you can extend that image to build additional images.Start a new container using the newly created node-base image:\\n\\n$ docker run --name=app-container -ti node-base\\nInside of this container, run the following command to create a Node program:\\n\\n$ echo \\'console.log(\"Hello from an app\")\\' > app.js\\nTo run this Node program, you can use the following command and see the message printed on the screen:\\n\\n$ node app.js\\nIn another terminal, run the following command to save this container’s changes as a new image:\\n\\n$ docker container commit -c \"CMD node app.js\" -m \"Add app\" app-container sample-app\\nThis command not only creates a new image named sample-app, but also adds additional configuration to the image to set the default command when starting a container. In this case, you are setting it to automatically run node app.js.In a terminal outside of the container, run the following command to view the updated layers:\\n\\n$ docker image history sample-app\\nYou’ll then see output that looks like the following. Note the top layer comment has “Add app” and the next layer has “Add node”:\\n\\nIMAGE          CREATED              CREATED BY                                      SIZE      COMMENT\\nc1502e2ec875   About a minute ago   /bin/bash                                       33B       Add app\\n5310da79c50a   4 minutes ago        /bin/bash                                       126MB     Add node\\n2b7cc08dcdbb   5 weeks ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD [\"/bin/bash\"]            0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:07cdbabf782942af0…   69.2MB\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop)  LABEL org.opencontainers.…   0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop)  LABEL org.opencontainers.…   0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ARG LAUNCHPAD_BUILD_ARCH     0B\\n<missing>      5 weeks ago          /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ARG RELEASE                  0B\\nFinally, start a new container using the brand new image. Since you specified the default command, you can use the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run sample-app\\nYou should see your greeting appear in the terminal, coming from your Node program.Now that you’re done with your containers, you can remove them using the following command:\\n\\n$ docker rm -f app-container\\nAdditional resourcesIf you’d like to dive deeper into the things you learned, check out the following resources:docker image historydocker container commitNext stepsAs hinted earlier, most image builds don’t use docker container commit.

It provides instructions to the image builder on the commands to run, files to copy, startup command, and more.As an example, the following Dockerfile would produce a ready-to-run Python application:\\n\\nFROM python:3.12\\nWORKDIR /usr/local/app\\n\\n# Install the application dependencies\\nCOPY requirements.txt ./\\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Copy in the source code\\nCOPY src ./src\\nEXPOSE 5000\\n\\n# Setup an app user so the container doesn\\'t run as the root user\\nRUN useradd app\\nUSER app\\n\\nCMD [\"uvicorn\", \"app.main:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8080\"]Common instructionsSome of the most common instructions in a Dockerfile include:FROM <image> - this specifies the base image that the build will extend.WORKDIR <path> - this instruction specifies the \"working directory\" or the path in the image where files will be copied and commands will be executed.COPY <host-path> <image-path> - this instruction tells the builder to copy files from the host and put them into the container image.RUN <command> - this instruction tells the builder to run the specified command.ENV <name> <value> - this instruction sets an environment variable that a running container will use.EXPOSE <port-number> - this instruction sets configuration on the image that indicates a port the image would like to expose.USER <user-or-uid> - this instruction sets the default user for all subsequent instructions.CMD [\"<command>\", \"<arg1>\"] - this instruction sets the default command a container using this image will run.To read through all of the instructions or go into greater detail, check out the\\nDockerfile reference.Try it outJust as you saw with the previous example, a Dockerfile typically follows these steps:Determine your base imageInstall application dependenciesCopy in any relevant source code and/or binariesConfigure the final imageIn this quick hands-on guide, you\\'ll write a Dockerfile that builds a simple Node.js application.

Some editors\\nwill automatically add an extension to the file (or complain it doesn\\'t have one).In the Dockerfile, define your base image by adding the following line:\\n\\nFROM node:20-alpineNow, define the working directory by using the WORKDIR instruction. This will specify where future commands will run and the directory files will be copied inside the container image.\\n\\nWORKDIR /appCopy all of the files from your project on your machine into the container image by using the COPY instruction:\\n\\nCOPY . .Install the app\\'s dependencies by using the yarn CLI and package manager. To do so, run a command using the RUN instruction:\\n\\nRUN yarn install --productionFinally, specify the default command to run by using the CMD instruction:\\n\\nCMD [\"node\", \"./src/index.js\"]And with that, you should have the following Dockerfile:\\n\\nFROM node:20-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN yarn install --production\\nCMD [\"node\", \"./src/index.js\"]This Dockerfile isn\\'t production-ready yetIt\\'s important to note that this Dockerfile is not following all\\nof the best practices yet (by design). It will build the app, but the\\nbuilds won\\'t be as fast, or the images as secure, as they could be.Keep reading to learn more about how to make the image maximize the\\nbuild cache, run as a non-root user, and multi-stage builds.Containerize new projects quickly with docker initThe docker init command will analyze your project and quickly create\\na Dockerfile, a compose.yaml, and a .dockerignore, helping you get\\nup and going.

The most basic docker build command might look like the following:\\n\\ndocker build .The final . in the command provides the path or URL to the\\nbuild context. At this location, the builder will find the Dockerfile and other referenced files.When you run a build, the builder pulls the base image, if needed, and then runs the instructions specified in the Dockerfile.With the previous command, the image will have no name, but the output will provide the ID of the image. As an example, the previous command might produce the following output:\\n\\n$ docker build .\\n[+] Building 3.5s (11/11) FINISHED                                              docker:desktop-linux\\n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                            0.0s\\n => => transferring dockerfile: 308B                                                            0.0s\\n => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.12                                  0.0s\\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                                                               0.0s\\n => => transferring context: 2B                                                                 0.0s\\n => [1/6] FROM docker.io/library/python:3.12                                                    0.0s\\n => [internal] load build context                                                               0.0s\\n => => transferring context: 123B                                                               0.0s\\n => [2/6] WORKDIR /usr/local/app                                                                0.0s\\n => [3/6] RUN useradd app                                                                       0.1s\\n => [4/6] COPY ./requirements.txt ./requirements.txt                                            0.0s\\n => [5/6] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt                          3.2s\\n => [6/6] COPY ./app ./app                                                                      0.0s\\n => exporting to image                                                                          0.1s\\n => => exporting layers                                                                         0.1s\\n => => writing image sha256:9924dfd9350407b3df01d1a0e1033b1e543523ce7d5d5e2c83a724480ebe8f00    0.0s\\nWith the previous output, you could start a container by using the referenced image:\\n\\ndocker run sha256:9924dfd9350407b3df01d1a0e1033b1e543523ce7d5d5e2c83a724480ebe8f00\\nThat name certainly isn\\'t memorable, which is where tagging becomes useful.Tagging imagesTagging images is the method to provide an image with a memorable name. However, there is a structure to the name of an image. A full image name has the following structure:\\n\\n[HOST[:PORT_NUMBER]/]PATH[:TAG]HOST: The optional registry hostname where the image is located. If no host is specified, Docker\\'s public registry at docker.io is used by default.PORT_NUMBER: The registry port number if a hostname is providedPATH: The path of the image, consisting of slash-separated components. For Docker Hub, the format follows [NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY, where namespace is either a user\\'s or organization\\'s name. If no namespace is specified, library is used, which is the namespace for Docker Official Images.TAG: A custom, human-readable identifier that\\'s typically used to identify different versions or variants of an image. If no tag is specified, latest is used by default.Some examples of image names include:nginx, equivalent to docker.io/library/nginx:latest: this pulls an image from the docker.io registry, the library namespace, the nginx image repository, and the latest tag.docker/welcome-to-docker, equivalent to docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker:latest: this pulls an image from the docker.io registry, the docker namespace, the welcome-to-docker image repository, and the latest tagghcr.io/dockersamples/example-voting-app-vote:pr-311: this pulls an image from the GitHub Container Registry, the dockersamples namespace, the example-voting-app-vote image repository, and the pr-311 tagTo tag an image during a build, add the -t or --tag flag:\\n\\ndocker build -t my-username/my-image .\\nIf you\\'ve already built an image, you can add another tag to the image by using the\\ndocker image tag command:\\n\\ndocker image tag my-username/my-image another-username/another-image:v1\\nPublishing imagesOnce you have an image built and tagged, you\\'re ready to push it to a registry. To do so, use the\\ndocker push command:\\n\\ndocker push my-username/my-image\\nWithin a few seconds, all of the layers for your image will be pushed to the registry.Requiring authenticationBefore you\\'re able to push an image to a repository, you will need to be authenticated.\\nTo do so, simply use the\\ndocker login command.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you will build a simple image using a provided Dockerfile and push it to Docker Hub.Set upGet the sample application.If you have Git, you can clone the repository for the sample application.

For each instruction, Docker checks whether it can reuse the instruction from a previous build. If it finds that you\\'ve already executed a similar instruction before, Docker doesn\\'t need to redo it. Instead, it’ll use the cached result. This way, your build process becomes faster and more efficient, saving you valuable time and resources.Using the build cache effectively lets you achieve faster builds by reusing results from previous builds and skipping unnecessary work.\\nIn order to maximize cache usage and avoid resource-intensive and time-consuming rebuilds, it\\'s important to understand how cache invalidation works.\\nHere are a few examples of situations that can cause cache to be invalidated:Any changes to the command of a RUN instruction invalidates that layer. Docker detects the change and invalidates the build cache if there\\'s any modification to a RUN command in your Dockerfile.Any changes to files copied into the image with the COPY or ADD instructions. Docker keeps an eye on any alterations to files within your project directory. Whether it\\'s a change in content or properties like permissions, Docker considers these modifications as triggers to invalidate the cache.Once one layer is invalidated, all following layers are also invalidated. If any previous layer, including the base image or intermediary layers, has been invalidated due to changes, Docker ensures that subsequent layers relying on it are also invalidated. This keeps the build process synchronized and prevents inconsistencies.When you\\'re writing or editing a Dockerfile, keep an eye out for unnecessary cache misses to ensure that builds run as fast and efficiently as possible.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you will learn how to use the Docker build cache effectively for a Node.js application.Build the applicationDownload and install Docker Desktop.Open a terminal and\\nclone this sample application.\\n\\n$ git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/todo-list-app\\nNavigate into the todo-list-app directory:\\n\\n$ cd todo-list-app\\nInside this directory, you\\'ll find a file named Dockerfile with the following content:\\n\\nFROM node:20-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN yarn install --production\\nEXPOSE 3000\\nCMD [\"node\", \"./src/index.js\"]Execute the following command to build the Docker image:\\n\\n$ docker build .\\nHere’s the result of the build process:\\n\\n[+] Building 20.0s (10/10) FINISHED\\nThe first line indicates that the entire build process took 20.0 seconds. The first build may take some time as it installs dependencies.Rebuild without making changes.Now, re-run the docker build command without making any change in the source code or Dockerfile as shown:\\n\\n$ docker build .\\nSubsequent builds after the initial are faster due to the caching mechanism, as long as the commands and context remain unchanged. Docker caches the intermediate layers generated during the build process. When you rebuild the image without making any changes to the Dockerfile or the source code, Docker can reuse the cached layers, significantly speeding up the build process.\\n\\n[+] Building 1.0s (9/9) FINISHED                                                                            docker:desktop-linux\\n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                                        0.0s\\n => => transferring dockerfile: 187B                                                                                        0.0s\\n ...\\n => [internal] load build context                                                                                           0.0s\\n => => transferring context: 8.16kB                                                                                         0.0s\\n => CACHED [2/4] WORKDIR /app                                                                                               0.0s\\n => CACHED [3/4] COPY . .                                                                                                   0.0s\\n => CACHED [4/4] RUN yarn install --production                                                                              0.0s\\n => exporting to image                                                                                                      0.0s\\n => => exporting layers                                                                                                     0.0s\\n => => exporting manifest\\nThe subsequent build was completed in just 1.0 second by leveraging the cached layers.

You might remember that when you made a change to the image, the yarn dependencies had to be reinstalled. Is there a way to fix this? It doesn\\'t make much sense to reinstall the same dependencies every time you build, right?To fix this, restructure your Dockerfile so that the dependency cache remains valid unless it really needs to be invalidated. For Node-based applications, dependencies are defined in the package.json file. You\\'ll want to reinstall the dependencies if that file changes, but use cached dependencies if the file is unchanged. So, start by copying only that file first, then install the dependencies, and finally copy everything else. Then, you only need to recreate the yarn dependencies if there was a change to the package.json file.Update the Dockerfile to copy in the package.json file first, install dependencies, and then copy everything else in.\\n\\nFROM node:20-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY package.json yarn.lock ./\\nRUN yarn install --production \\nCOPY . . \\nEXPOSE 3000\\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/index.js\"]Create a file named .dockerignore in the same folder as the Dockerfile with the following contents.\\n\\nnode_modulesBuild the new image:\\n\\n$ docker build .\\nYou\\'ll then see output similar to the following:\\n\\n[+] Building 16.1s (10/10) FINISHED\\n=> [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                               0.0s\\n=> => transferring dockerfile: 175B                                                               0.0s\\n=> [internal] load .dockerignore                                                                  0.0s\\n=> => transferring context: 2B                                                                    0.0s\\n=> [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:21-alpine                                  0.0s\\n=> [internal] load build context                                                                  0.8s\\n=> => transferring context: 53.37MB                                                               0.8s\\n=> [1/5] FROM docker.io/library/node:21-alpine                                                    0.0s\\n=> CACHED [2/5] WORKDIR /app                                                                      0.0s\\n=> [3/5] COPY package.json yarn.lock ./                                                           0.2s\\n=> [4/5] RUN yarn install --production                                                           14.0s\\n=> [5/5] COPY . .                                                                                 0.5s\\n=> exporting to image                                                                             0.6s\\n=> => exporting layers                                                                            0.6s\\n=> => writing image     \\nsha256:d6f819013566c54c50124ed94d5e66c452325327217f4f04399b45f94e37d25        0.0s\\n=> => naming to docker.io/library/node-app:2.0                                                 0.0s\\nYou\\'ll see that all layers were rebuilt.

All those layers end up in your final image. This approach works, but it leads to bulky images carrying unnecessary weight and increasing your security risks. This is where multi-stage builds come in.Multi-stage builds introduce multiple stages in your Dockerfile, each with a specific purpose. Think of it like the ability to run different parts of a build in multiple different environments, concurrently. By separating the build environment from the final runtime environment, you can significantly reduce the image size and attack surface. This is especially beneficial for applications with large build dependencies.Multi-stage builds are recommended for all types of applications.For interpreted languages, like JavaScript or Ruby or Python, you can build and minify your code in one stage, and copy the production-ready files to a smaller runtime image. This optimizes your image for deployment.For compiled languages, like C or Go or Rust, multi-stage builds let you compile in one stage and copy the compiled binaries into a final runtime image. No need to bundle the entire compiler in your final image.Here\\'s a simplified example of a multi-stage build structure using pseudo-code. Notice there are multiple FROM statements and a new AS <stage-name>. In addition, the COPY statement in the second stage is copying --from the previous stage.\\n\\n# Stage 1: Build Environment\\nFROM builder-image AS build-stage \\n# Install build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle)\\n# Copy source code\\n# Build commands (e.g., compile, package)\\n\\n# Stage 2: Runtime environment\\nFROM runtime-image AS final-stage  \\n#  Copy application artifacts from the build stage (e.g., JAR file)\\nCOPY --from=build-stage /path/in/build/stage /path/to/place/in/final/stage\\n# Define runtime configuration (e.g., CMD, ENTRYPOINT) This Dockerfile uses two stages:The build stage uses a base image containing build tools needed to compile your application. It includes commands to install build tools, copy source code, and execute build commands.The final stage uses a smaller base image suitable for running your application. It copies the compiled artifacts (a JAR file, for example) from the build stage. Finally, it defines the runtime configuration (using CMD or ENTRYPOINT) for starting your application.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you\\'ll unlock the power of multi-stage builds to create lean and efficient Docker images for a sample Java application.

This will specify where future commands will run and the directory files will be copied inside the container image.\\n\\nWORKDIR /appCopy both the Maven wrapper script and your project\\'s pom.xml file into the current working directory /app within the Docker container.\\n\\nCOPY .mvn/ .mvn\\nCOPY mvnw pom.xml ./Execute a command within the container.

This stage is given the name of builder.The second stage is a new stage named final. It uses a slimmer eclipse-temurin:21.0.2_13-jre-jammy image, containing just the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) needed to run the application. This image provides a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is enough for running the compiled application (JAR file).For production use, it\\'s highly recommended that you produce a custom JRE-like runtime using jlink. JRE images are available for all versions of Eclipse Temurin, but jlink allows you to create a minimal runtime containing only the necessary Java modules for your application. This can significantly reduce the size and improve the security of your final image.\\nRefer to this page for more information.With multi-stage builds, a Docker build uses one base image for compilation, packaging, and unit tests and then a separate image for the application runtime. As a result, the final image is smaller in size since it doesn’t contain any development or debugging tools. By separating the build environment from the final runtime environment, you can significantly reduce the image size and increase the security of your final images.Now, rebuild your image and run your ready-to-use production build.\\n\\n$ docker build -t spring-helloworld-builder .\\nThis command builds a Docker image named spring-helloworld-builder using the final stage from your Dockerfile file located in the current directory.\\nNoteIn your multi-stage Dockerfile, the final stage (final) is the default target for building. This means that if you don\\'t explicitly specify a target stage using the --target flag in the docker build command, Docker will automatically build the last stage by default. You could use docker build -t spring-helloworld-builder --target builder . to build only the builder stage with the JDK environment.Look at the image size difference by using the docker images command:\\n\\n$ docker images\\nYou\\'ll get output similar to the following:\\n\\nspring-helloworld-builder latest    c5c76cb815c0   24 minutes ago      428MB\\nspring-helloworld         latest    ff708d5ee194   About an hour ago   880MB\\nYour final image is just 428 MB, compared to the original build size of 880 MB.By optimizing each stage and only including what\\'s necessary, you were able to significantly reduce the overall image size while still achieving the same functionality. This not only improves performance but also makes your Docker images more lightweight, more secure, and easier to manage.Additional resourcesMulti-stage buildsDockerfile best practicesBase imagesSpring Boot DockerPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationTry it outCreate the DockerfileBuild the container imageRun the Spring Boot applicationUse multi-stage buildsAdditional resources'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nRunning containers\\n/\\nPublishing and exposing portsPublishing and exposing portsTable of contentsExplanationPublishing portsPublishing to ephemeral portsPublishing all portsTry it outUse the Docker CLIUse Docker ComposeAdditional resourcesNext stepsExplanationIf you\\'ve been following the guides so far, you understand that containers provide isolated processes for each component of your application. Each component - a React frontend, a Python API, and a Postgres database - runs in its own sandbox environment, completely isolated from everything else on your host machine. This isolation is great for security and managing dependencies, but it also means you can’t access them directly. For example, you can’t access the web app in your browser.That’s where port publishing comes in.Publishing portsPublishing a port provides the ability to break through a little bit of networking isolation by setting up a forwarding rule. As an example, you can indicate that requests on your host’s port 8080 should be forwarded to the container’s port 80. Publishing ports happens during container creation using the -p (or --publish) flag with docker run. The syntax is:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT nginx\\nHOST_PORT: The port number on your host machine where you want to receive trafficCONTAINER_PORT: The port number within the container that\\'s listening for connectionsFor example, to publish the container\\'s port 80 to host port 8080:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx\\nNow, any traffic sent to port 8080 on your host machine will be forwarded to port 80 within the container.\\nImportantWhen a port is published, it\\'s published to all network interfaces by default. This means any traffic that reaches your machine can access the published application. Be mindful of publishing databases or any sensitive information.\\nLearn more about published ports here.Publishing to ephemeral portsAt times, you may want to simply publish the port but don’t care which host port is used. In these cases, you can let Docker pick the port for you. To do so, simply omit the HOST_PORT configuration.For example, the following command will publish the container’s port 80 onto an ephemeral port on the host:\\n\\n$ docker run -p 80 nginx\\nOnce the container is running, using docker ps will show you the port that was chosen:\\n\\ndocker ps\\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES\\na527355c9c53   nginx         \"/docker-entrypoint.…\"   4 seconds ago    Up 3 seconds    0.0.0.0:54772->80/tcp    romantic_williamson\\nIn this example, the app is exposed on the host at port 54772.Publishing all portsWhen creating a container image, the EXPOSE instruction is used to indicate the packaged application will use the specified port. These ports aren\\'t published by default.With the -P or --publish-all flag, you can automatically publish all exposed ports to ephemeral ports. This is quite useful when you’re trying to avoid port conflicts in development or testing environments.For example, the following command will publish all of the exposed ports configured by the image:\\n\\n$ docker run -P nginx\\nTry it outIn this hands-on guide, you\\'ll learn how to publish container ports using both the CLI and Docker Compose for deploying a web application.Use the Docker CLIIn this step, you will run a container and publish its port using the Docker CLI.Download and install Docker Desktop.In a terminal, run the following command to start a new container:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker\\nThe first 8080 refers to the host port. This is the port on your local machine that will be used to access the application running inside the container. The second 80 refers to the container port. This is the port that the application inside the container listens on for incoming connections. Hence, the command binds to port 8080 of the host to port 80 on the container system.Verify the published port by going to the Containers view of the Docker Desktop Dashboard.\\nOpen the website by either selecting the link in the Port(s) column of your container or visiting\\nhttp://localhost:8080 in your browser.\\nUse Docker ComposeThis example will launch the same application using Docker Compose:Create a new directory and inside that directory, create a compose.yaml file with the following contents:\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: docker/welcome-to-docker\\n    ports:\\n      - 8080:80The ports configuration accepts a few different forms of syntax for the port definition. In this case, you’re using the same HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT used in the docker run command.Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you created in the previous step.Use the docker compose up command to start the application.Open your browser to\\nhttp://localhost:8080.Additional resourcesIf you’d like to dive in deeper on this topic, be sure to check out the following resources:docker container port CLI referencePublished portsNext stepsNow that you understand how to publish and expose ports, you\\'re ready to learn how to override the container defaults using the docker run command.Overriding container defaultsPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationPublishing portsPublishing to ephemeral portsPublishing all portsTry it outUse the Docker CLIUse Docker ComposeAdditional resourcesNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/overriding-container-defaults/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nRunning containers\\n/\\nOverriding container defaultsOverriding container defaultsTable of contentsExplanationOverriding the network portsSetting environment variablesRestricting the container to consume the resourcesTry it outRun multiple instances of the Postgres databaseRun Postgres container in a controlled networkManage the resourcesOverride the default CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker ComposeOverride the default CMD and ENTRYPOINT with docker runAdditional resourcesNext stepsExplanationWhen a Docker container starts, it executes an application or command. The container gets this executable (script or file) from its image’s configuration. Containers come with default settings that usually work well, but you can change them if needed. These adjustments help the container\\'s program run exactly how you want it to.For example, if you have an existing database container that listens on the standard port and you want to run a new instance of the same database container, then you might want to change the port settings the new container listens on so that it doesn’t conflict with the existing container. Sometimes you might want to increase the memory available to the container if the program needs more resources to handle a heavy workload or set the environment variables to provide specific configuration details the program needs to function properly.The docker run command offers a powerful way to override these defaults and tailor the container\\'s behavior to your liking. The command offers several flags that let you to customize container behavior on the fly.Here\\'s a few ways you can achieve this.Overriding the network portsSometimes you might want to use separate database instances for development and testing purposes. Running these database instances on the same port might conflict. You can use the -p option in docker run to map container ports to host ports, allowing you to run the multiple instances of the container without any conflict.\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT postgres\\nSetting environment variablesThis option sets an environment variable foo inside the container with the value bar.\\n\\n$ docker run -e foo=bar postgres env\\nYou will see output like the following:\\n\\nHOSTNAME=2042f2e6ebe4\\nfoo=bar\\n\\nTipThe .env file acts as a convenient way to set environment variables for your Docker containers without cluttering your command line with numerous -e flags. To use a .env file, you can pass --env-file option with the docker run command.\\n\\n$ docker run --env-file .env postgres env\\nRestricting the container to consume the resourcesYou can use the --memory and --cpus flags with the docker run command to restrict how much CPU and memory a container can use. For example, you can set a memory limit for the Python API container, preventing it from consuming excessive resources on your host. Here\\'s the command:\\n\\n$ docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret --memory=\"512m\" --cpus=\"0.5\" postgres\\nThis command limits container memory usage to 512 MB and defines the CPU quota of 0.5 for half a core.Monitor the real-time resource usageYou can use the docker stats command to monitor the real-time resource usage of running containers. This helps you understand whether the allocated resources are sufficient or need adjustment.By effectively using these docker run flags, you can tailor your containerized application\\'s behavior to fit your specific requirements.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you\\'ll see how to use the docker run command to override the container defaults.Download and install Docker Desktop.Run multiple instances of the Postgres databaseStart a container using the\\nPostgres image with the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5432:5432 postgres\\nThis will start the Postgres database in the background, listening on the standard container port 5432 and mapped to port 5432 on the host machine.Start a second Postgres container mapped to a different port.\\n\\n$ docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5433:5432 postgres\\nThis will start another Postgres container in the background, listening on the standard postgres port 5432 in the container, but mapped to port 5433 on the host machine. You override the host port just to ensure that this new container doesn\\'t conflict with the existing running container.Verify that both containers are running by going to the Containers view in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.\\nRun Postgres container in a controlled networkBy default, containers automatically connect to a special network called a bridge network when you run them. This bridge network acts like a virtual bridge, allowing containers on the same host to communicate with each other while keeping them isolated from the outside world and other hosts. It\\'s a convenient starting point for most container interactions. However, for specific scenarios, you might want more control over the network configuration.Here\\'s where the custom network comes in. You create a custom network by passing --network flag with the docker run command. All containers without a --network flag are attached to the default bridge network.Follow the steps to see how to connect a Postgres container to a custom network.Create a new custom network by using the following command:\\n\\n$ docker network create mynetwork\\nVerify the network by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker network ls\\nThis command lists all networks, including the newly created \"mynetwork\".Connect Postgres to the custom network by using the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5434:5432 --network mynetwork postgres\\nThis will start Postgres container in the background, mapped to the host port 5434 and attached to the mynetwork network. You passed the --network parameter to override the container default by connecting the container to custom Docker network for better isolation and communication with other containers. You can use docker network inspect command to see if the container is tied to this new bridge network.Key difference between default bridge and custom networksDNS resolution: By default, containers connected to the default bridge network can communicate with each other, but only by IP address. (unless you use --link option which is considered legacy). It is not recommended for production use due to the various\\ntechnical shortcomings. On a custom network, containers can resolve each other by name or alias.Isolation: All containers without a --network specified are attached to the default bridge network, hence can be a risk, as unrelated containers are then able to communicate. Using a custom network provides a scoped network in which only containers attached to that network are able to communicate, hence providing better isolation.Manage the resourcesBy default, containers are not limited in their resource usage. However, on shared systems, it\\'s crucial to manage resources effectively. It\\'s important not to let a running container consume too much of the host machine\\'s memory.This is where the docker run command shines again. It offers flags like --memory and --cpus to restrict how much CPU and memory a container can use.\\n\\n$ docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret --memory=\"512m\" --cpus=\".5\" postgres\\nThe --cpus flag specifies the CPU quota for the container. Here, it\\'s set to half a CPU core (0.5) whereas the --memory flag specifies the memory limit for the container. In this case, it\\'s set to 512 MB.Override the default CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker ComposeSometimes, you might need to override the default commands (CMD) or entry points (ENTRYPOINT) defined in a Docker image, especially when using Docker Compose.Create a compose.yml file with the following content:\\n\\nservices:\\n  postgres:\\n    image: postgres\\n    entrypoint: [\"docker-entrypoint.sh\", \"postgres\"]\\n    command: [\"-h\", \"localhost\", \"-p\", \"5432\"]\\n    environment:\\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret The Compose file defines a service named postgres that uses the official Postgres image, sets an entrypoint script, and starts the container with password authentication.Bring up the service by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker compose up -d\\nThis command starts the Postgres service defined in the Docker Compose file.Verify the authentication with Docker Desktop Dashboard.Open the Docker Desktop Dashboard, select the Postgres container and select Exec to enter into the container shell. You can type the following command to connect to the Postgres database:\\n\\n# psql -U postgres\\n\\n\\nNoteThe PostgreSQL image sets up trust authentication locally so you may notice a password isn\\'t required when connecting from localhost (inside the same container). However, a password will be required if connecting from a different host/container.Override the default CMD and ENTRYPOINT with docker runYou can also override defaults directly using the docker run command with the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret postgres docker-entrypoint.sh -h localhost -p 5432\\nThis command runs a Postgres container, sets an environment variable for password authentication, overrides the default startup commands and configures hostname and port mapping.Additional resourcesWays to set environment variables with ComposeWhat is a containerNext stepsNow that you have learned about overriding container defaults, it\\'s time to learn how to persist container data.Persisting container dataPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationOverriding the network portsSetting environment variablesRestricting the container to consume the resourcesTry it outRun multiple instances of the Postgres databaseRun Postgres container in a controlled networkManage the resourcesOverride the default CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Docker ComposeOverride the default CMD and ENTRYPOINT with docker runAdditional resourcesNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/persisting-container-data/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nRunning containers\\n/\\nPersisting container dataPersisting container dataTable of contentsExplanationContainer volumesManaging volumesTry it outUse volumesView volume contentsRemove volumesAdditional resourcesNext stepsExplanationWhen a container starts, it uses the files and configuration provided by the image. Each container is able to create, modify, and delete files and does so without affecting any other containers. When the container is deleted, these file changes are also deleted.While this ephemeral nature of containers is great, it poses a challenge when you want to persist the data. For example, if you restart a database container, you might not want to start with an empty database. So, how do you persist files?Container volumesVolumes are a storage mechanism that provide the ability to persist data beyond the lifecycle of an individual container. Think of it like providing a shortcut or symlink from inside the container to outside the container.As an example, imagine you create a volume named log-data.\\n\\n$ docker volume create log-data\\nWhen starting a container with the following command, the volume will be mounted (or attached) into the container at /logs:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p 80:80 -v log-data:/logs docker/welcome-to-docker\\nIf the volume log-data doesn\\'t exist, Docker will automatically create it for you.When the container runs, all files it writes into the /logs folder will be saved in this volume, outside of the container. If you delete the container and start a new container using the same volume, the files will still be there.Sharing files using volumesYou can attach the same volume to multiple containers to share files between containers. This might be helpful in scenarios such as log aggregation, data pipelines, or other event-driven applications.Managing volumesVolumes have their own lifecycle beyond that of containers and can grow quite large depending on the type of data and applications you’re using. The following commands will be helpful to manage volumes:docker volume ls - list all volumesdocker volume rm <volume-name-or-id> - remove a volume (only works when the volume is not attached to any containers)docker volume prune - remove all unused (unattached) volumesTry it outIn this guide, you’ll practice creating and using volumes to persist data created by a Postgres container. When the database runs, it stores files into the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory. By attaching the volume here, you will be able to restart the container multiple times while keeping the data.Use volumesDownload and install Docker Desktop.Start a container using the\\nPostgres image with the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run --name=db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -d -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres\\nThis will start the database in the background, configure it with a password, and attach a volume to the directory PostgreSQL will persist the database files.Connect to the database by using the following command:\\n\\n$ docker exec -ti db psql -U postgres\\nIn the PostgreSQL command line, run the following to create a database table and insert two records:\\n\\nCREATE TABLE tasks (\\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n    description VARCHAR(100)\\n);\\nINSERT INTO tasks (description) VALUES (\\'Finish work\\'), (\\'Have fun\\');Verify the data is in the database by running the following in the PostgreSQL command line:\\n\\nSELECT * FROM tasks;You should get output that looks like the following:\\n\\n id | description\\n----+-------------\\n  1 | Finish work\\n  2 | Have fun\\n(2 rows)Exit out of the PostgreSQL shell by running the following command:\\n\\n\\\\q\\nStop and remove the database container. Remember that, even though the container has been deleted, the data is persisted in the postgres_data volume.\\n\\n$ docker stop db\\n$ docker rm db\\nStart a new container by running the following command, attaching the same volume with the persisted data:\\n\\n$ docker run --name=new-db -d -v postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres \\nYou might have noticed that the POSTGRES_PASSWORD environment variable has been omitted. That’s because that variable is only used when bootstrapping a new database.Verify the database still has the records by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker exec -ti new-db psql -U postgres -c \"SELECT * FROM tasks\"\\nView volume contentsThe Docker Desktop Dashboard provides the ability to view the contents of any volume, as well as the ability to export, import, and clone volumes.Open the Docker Desktop Dashboard and navigate to the Volumes view. In this view, you should see the postgres_data volume.Select the postgres_data volume’s name.The Data tab shows the contents of the volume and provides the ability to navigate the files. Double-clicking on a file will let you see the contents and make changes.Right-click on any file to save it or delete it.Remove volumesBefore removing a volume, it must not be attached to any containers. If you haven’t removed the previous container, do so with the following command (the -f will stop the container first and then remove it):\\n\\n$ docker rm -f new-db\\nThere are a few methods to remove volumes, including the following:Select the Delete Volume option on a volume in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.Use the docker volume rm command:\\n\\n$ docker volume rm postgres_data\\nUse the docker volume prune command to remove all unused volumes:\\n\\n$ docker volume prune\\nAdditional resourcesThe following resources will help you learn more about volumes:Manage data in DockerVolumesVolume mountsNext stepsNow that you have learned about persisting container data, it’s time to learn about sharing local files with containers.Sharing local files with containersPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationContainer volumesManaging volumesTry it outUse volumesView volume contentsRemove volumesAdditional resourcesNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/sharing-local-files/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nRunning containers\\n/\\nSharing local files with containersSharing local files with containersTable of contentsExplanationVolume versus bind mountsSharing files between a host and containerFile permissions for Docker access to host filesTry it outRun a containerUse a bind mountAccess the file on the Docker Desktop DashboardStop your containerAdditional resourcesNext stepsExplanationEach container has everything it needs to function with no reliance on any pre-installed dependencies on the host machine. Since containers run in isolation, they have minimal influence on the host and other containers. This isolation has a major benefit: containers minimize conflicts with the host system and other containers. However, this isolation also means containers can\\'t directly access data on the host machine by default.Consider a scenario where you have a web application container that requires access to configuration settings stored in a file on your host system. This file may contain sensitive data such as database credentials or API keys. Storing such sensitive information directly within the container image poses security risks, especially during image sharing. To address this challenge, Docker offers storage options that bridge the gap between container isolation and your host machine\\'s data.Docker offers two primary storage options for persisting data and sharing files between the host machine and containers: volumes and bind mounts.Volume versus bind mountsIf you want to ensure that data generated or modified inside the container persists even after the container stops running, you would opt for a volume. See\\nPersisting container data to learn more about volumes and their use cases.If you have specific files or directories on your host system that you want to directly share with your container, like configuration files or development code, then you would use a bind mount. It\\'s like opening a direct portal between your host and container for sharing. Bind mounts are ideal for development environments where real-time file access and sharing between the host and container are crucial.Sharing files between a host and containerBoth -v (or --volume) and --mount flags used with the docker run command let you share files or directories between your local machine (host) and a Docker container. However, there are some key differences in their behavior and usage.The -v flag is simpler and more convenient for basic volume or bind mount operations. If the host location doesn’t exist when using -v or --volume, a directory will be automatically created.Imagine you\\'re a developer working on a project. You have a source directory on your development machine where your code resides. When you compile or build your code, the generated artifacts (compiled code, executables, images, etc.) are saved in a separate subdirectory within your source directory. In the following examples, this subdirectory is /HOST/PATH. Now you want these build artifacts to be accessible within a Docker container running your application. Additionally, you want the container to automatically access the latest build artifacts whenever you rebuild your code.Here\\'s a way to use docker run to start a container using a bind mount and map it to the container file location.\\n\\n$ docker run -v /HOST/PATH:/CONTAINER/PATH -it nginx\\nThe --mount flag offers more advanced features and granular control, making it suitable for complex mount scenarios or production deployments. If you use --mount to bind-mount a file or directory that doesn\\'t yet exist on the Docker host, the docker run command doesn\\'t automatically create it for you but generates an error.\\n\\n$ docker run --mount type=bind,source=/HOST/PATH,target=/CONTAINER/PATH,readonly nginx\\n\\nNoteDocker recommends using the --mount syntax instead of -v. It provides better control over the mounting process and avoids potential issues with missing directories.File permissions for Docker access to host filesWhen using bind mounts, it\\'s crucial to ensure that Docker has the necessary permissions to access the host directory. To grant read/write access, you can use the :ro flag (read-only) or :rw (read-write) with the -v or --mount flag during container creation.\\nFor example, the following command grants read-write access permission.\\n\\n$ docker run -v HOST-DIRECTORY:/CONTAINER-DIRECTORY:rw nginx\\nRead-only bind mounts let the container access the mounted files on the host for reading, but it can\\'t change or delete the files. With read-write bind mounts, containers can modify or delete mounted files, and these changes or deletions will also be reflected on the host system. Read-only bind mounts ensures that files on the host can\\'t be accidentally modified or deleted by a container.Synchronized File ShareAs your codebase grows larger, traditional methods of file sharing like bind mounts may become inefficient or slow, especially in development environments where frequent access to files is necessary.\\nSynchronized file shares improve bind mount performance by leveraging synchronized filesystem caches. This optimization ensures that file access between the host and virtual machine (VM) is fast and efficient.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you’ll practice how to create and use a bind mount to share files between a host and a container.Run a containerDownload and install Docker Desktop.Start a container using the\\nhttpd image with the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my_site httpd:2.4\\nThis will start the httpd service in the background, and publish the webpage to port 8080 on the host.Open the browser and access\\nhttp://localhost:8080 or use the curl command to verify if it\\'s working fine or not.\\n\\n$ curl localhost:8080\\nUse a bind mountUsing a bind mount, you can map the configuration file on your host computer to a specific location within the container. In this example, you’ll see how to change the look and feel of the webpage by using bind mount:Delete the existing container by using the Docker Desktop Dashboard:\\nCreate a new directory called public_html on your host system.\\n\\n$ mkdir public_html\\nNavigate into the newly created directory public_html and create a file called index.html with the following content. This is a basic HTML document that creates a simple webpage that welcomes you with a friendly whale.\\n\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\"en\">\\n<head>\\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\\n<title> My Website with a Whale & Docker!</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n<h1>Whalecome!!</h1>\\n<p>Look!

You can\\'t run them both unless you remove the my_site container after running the first one.\\n-v\\n\\n\\n--mount\\n\\n$ docker run -d --name my_site -p 8080:80 -v .:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4\\n\\n\\n$ docker run -d --name my_site -p 8080:80 --mount type=bind,source=./,target=/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4\\n\\nTipWhen using the -v or --mount flag in Windows PowerShell, you need to provide the absolute path to your directory instead of just ./. This is because PowerShell handles relative paths differently from bash (commonly used in Mac and Linux environments).With everything now up and running, you should be able to access the site via\\nhttp://localhost:8080 and find a new webpage that welcomes you with a friendly whale.Access the file on the Docker Desktop DashboardYou can view the mounted files inside a container by selecting the container\\'s Files tab and then selecting a file inside the /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ directory. Then, select Open file editor.\\nDelete the file on the host and verify the file is also deleted in the container. You will find that the files no longer exist under Files in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.\\nRecreate the HTML file on the host system and see that file re-appears under the Files tab under Containers on the Docker Desktop Dashboard. By now, you will be able to access the site too.Stop your containerThe container continues to run until you stop it.Go to the Containers view in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.Locate the container you\\'d like to stop.Select the Delete action in the Actions column.\\nAdditional resourcesThe following resources will help you learn more about bind mounts:Manage data in DockerVolumesBind mountsRunning containersTroubleshoot storage errorsPersisting container dataNext stepsNow that you have learned about sharing local files with containers, it’s time to learn about multi-container applications.Multi-container applicationsPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationVolume versus bind mountsSharing files between a host and containerFile permissions for Docker access to host filesTry it outRun a containerUse a bind mountAccess the file on the Docker Desktop DashboardStop your containerAdditional resourcesNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/multi-container-applications/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker concepts\\n/\\nRunning containers\\n/\\nMulti-container applicationsMulti-container applicationsTable of contentsExplanationTry it outSet upBuild the imagesRun the containersSimplify the deployment using Docker ComposeAdditional resourcesExplanationStarting up a single-container application is easy. For example, a Python script that performs a specific data processing task runs within a container with all its dependencies. Similarly, a Node.js application serving a static website with a small API endpoint can be effectively containerized with all its necessary libraries and dependencies. However, as applications grow in size, managing them as individual containers becomes more difficult.Imagine the data processing Python script needs to connect to a database. Suddenly, you\\'re now managing not just the script but also a database server within the same container. If the script requires user logins, you\\'ll need an authentication mechanism, further bloating the container size.One best practice for containers is that each container should do one thing and do it well. While there are exceptions to this rule, avoid the tendency to have one container do multiple things.Now you might ask, \"Do I need to run these containers separately? If I run them separately, how shall I connect them all together?\"While docker run is a convenient tool for launching containers, it becomes difficult to manage a growing application stack with it. Here\\'s why:Imagine running several docker run commands (frontend, backend, and database) with different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. It\\'s error-prone and time-consuming.Applications often rely on each other. Manually starting containers in a specific order and managing network connections become difficult as the stack expands.Each application needs its docker run command, making it difficult to scale individual services. Scaling the entire application means potentially wasting resources on components that don\\'t need a boost.Persisting data for each application requires separate volume mounts or configurations within each docker run command. This creates a scattered data management approach.Setting environment variables for each application through separate docker run commands is tedious and error-prone.That\\'s where Docker Compose comes to the rescue.Docker Compose defines your entire multi-container application in a single YAML file called compose.yml. This file specifies configurations for all your containers, their dependencies, environment variables, and even volumes and networks. With Docker Compose:You don\\'t need to run multiple docker run commands. All you need to do is define your entire multi-container application in a single YAML file. This centralizes configuration and simplifies management.You can run containers in a specific order and manage network connections easily.You can simply scale individual services up or down within the multi-container setup. This allows for efficient allocation based on real-time needs.You can implement persistent volumes with ease.It\\'s easy to set environment variables once in your Docker Compose file.By leveraging Docker Compose for running multi-container setups, you can build complex applications with modularity, scalability, and consistency at their core.Try it outIn this hands-on guide, you\\'ll first see how to build and run a counter web application based on Node.js, an Nginx reverse proxy, and a Redis database using the docker run commands. You’ll also see how you can simplify the entire deployment process using Docker Compose.Set upGet the sample application. If you have Git, you can clone the repository for the sample application. Otherwise, you can download the sample application. Choose one of the following options.\\nClone with git\\n\\n\\nDownloadUse the following command in a terminal to clone the sample application repository.\\n\\n$ git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/nginx-node-redis\\nNavigate into the nginx-node-redis directory:\\n\\n$ cd nginx-node-redis\\nInside this directory, you\\'ll find two sub-directories - nginx and web.Download the source and extract it.Download the sourceNavigate into the nginx-node-redis-main directory:\\n\\n$ cd nginx-node-redis-main\\nInside this directory, you\\'ll find two sub-directories - nginx and web.Download and install Docker Desktop.Build the imagesNavigate into the nginx directory to build the image by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker build -t nginx .\\nNavigate into the web directory and run the following command to build the first web image:\\n\\n$ docker build -t web .\\nRun the containersBefore you can run a multi-container application, you need to create a network for them all to communicate through. You can do so using the docker network create command:\\n\\n$ docker network create sample-app\\nStart the Redis container by running the following command, which will attach it to the previously created network and create a network alias (useful for DNS lookups):\\n\\n$ docker run -d  --name redis --network sample-app --network-alias redis redis\\nStart the first web container by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run -d --name web1 -h web1 --network sample-app --network-alias web1 web\\nStart the second web container by running the following:\\n\\n$ docker run -d --name web2 -h web2 --network sample-app --network-alias web2 web\\nStart the Nginx container by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker run -d --name nginx --network sample-app  -p 80:80 nginx\\n\\nNoteNginx is typically used as a reverse proxy for web applications, routing traffic to backend servers. In this case, it routes to the Node.js backend containers (web1 or web2).Verify the containers are up by running the following command:\\n\\n$ docker ps\\nYou will see output like the following:\\n\\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                NAMES\\n2cf7c484c144   nginx     \"/docker-entrypoint.…\"   9 seconds ago        Up 8 seconds        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   nginx\\n7a070c9ffeaa   web       \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   19 seconds ago       Up 18 seconds                            web2\\n6dc6d4e60aaf   web       \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   34 seconds ago       Up 33 seconds                            web1\\n008e0ecf4f36   redis     \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   6379/tcp             redisIf you look at the Docker Desktop Dashboard, you can see the containers and dive deeper into their configuration.\\nWith everything up and running, you can open\\nhttp://localhost in your browser to see the site. Refresh the page several times to see the host that’s handling the request and the total number of requests:\\n\\nweb2: Number of visits is: 9\\nweb1: Number of visits is: 10\\nweb2: Number of visits is: 11\\nweb1: Number of visits is: 12\\n\\nNoteYou might have noticed that Nginx, acting as a reverse proxy, likely distributes incoming requests in a round-robin fashion between the two backend containers. This means each request might be directed to a different container (web1 and web2) on a rotating basis. The output shows consecutive increments for both the web1 and web2 containers and the actual counter value stored in Redis is updated only after the response is sent back to the client.You can use the Docker Desktop Dashboard to remove the containers by selecting the containers and selecting the Delete button.\\nSimplify the deployment using Docker ComposeDocker Compose provides a structured and streamlined approach for managing multi-container deployments. As stated earlier, with Docker Compose, you don’t need to run multiple docker run commands. All you need to do is define your entire multi-container application in a single YAML file called compose.yml. Let’s see how it works.Navigate to the root of the project directory. Inside this directory, you\\'ll find a file named compose.yml. This YAML file is where all the magic happens. It defines all the services that make up your application, along with their configurations. Each service specifies its image, ports, volumes, networks, and any other settings necessary for its functionality.Use the docker compose up command to start the application:\\n\\n$ docker compose up -d --build\\nWhen you run this command, you should see output similar to the following:\\n\\nRunning 5/5\\n✔ Network nginx-nodejs-redis_default    Created                                                0.0s\\n✔ Container nginx-nodejs-redis-web1-1   Started                                                0.1s\\n✔ Container nginx-nodejs-redis-redis-1  Started                                                0.1s\\n✔ Container nginx-nodejs-redis-web2-1   Started                                                0.1s\\n✔ Container nginx-nodejs-redis-nginx-1  Started\\nIf you look at the Docker Desktop Dashboard, you can see the containers and dive deeper into their configuration.\\nAlternatively, you can use the Docker Desktop Dashboard to remove the containers by selecting the application stack and selecting the Delete button.\\nIn this guide, you learned how easy it is to use Docker Compose to start and stop a multi-container application compared to docker run which is error-prone and difficult to manage.Additional resourcesdocker container run CLI referenceWhat is Docker ComposePage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsExplanationTry it outSet upBuild the imagesRun the containersSimplify the deployment using Docker ComposeAdditional resources'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/'}, page_content=\"Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker workshopOverview of the Docker workshopTable of contentsWhat is a container?What is an image?Next stepsThis 45-minute workshop contains step-by-step instructions on how to get started with Docker. This workshop shows you how to:Build and run an image as a container.Share images using Docker Hub.Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database.Run applications using Docker Compose.\\nNoteFor a quick introduction to Docker and the benefits of containerizing your\\napplications, see\\nGetting started.What is a container?A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine. That isolation leverages\\nkernel namespaces and cgroups,\\nfeatures that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker makes these capabilities approachable and easy to use. To summarize, a container:Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.Can be run on local machines, virtual machines, or deployed to the cloud.Is portable (and can be run on any OS).Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, configurations, etc.If you're familiar with chroot, then think of a container as an extended version of chroot. The filesystem comes from the image. However, a container adds additional isolation not available when using chroot.What is an image?A running container uses an isolated filesystem. This isolated filesystem is provided by an image, and the image must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configurations for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.Next stepsIn this section, you learned about containers and images.Next, you'll containerize a simple application and get hands-on with the concepts.Containerize an applicationPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsWhat is a container?What is an image?Next steps\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/02_our_app/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker workshop\\n/\\nPart 1: Containerize an applicationContainerize an applicationTable of contentsPrerequisitesGet the appBuild the app\\'s imageStart an app containerSummaryNext stepsFor the rest of this guide, you\\'ll be working with a simple todo\\nlist manager that runs on Node.js. If you\\'re not familiar with Node.js,\\ndon\\'t worry. This guide doesn\\'t require any prior experience with JavaScript.PrerequisitesYou have installed the latest version of\\nDocker Desktop.You have installed a\\nGit client.You have an IDE or a text editor to edit files. Docker recommends using\\nVisual Studio Code.Get the appBefore you can run the application, you need to get the application source code onto your machine.Clone the\\ngetting-started-app repository using the following command:\\n\\n$ git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git\\nView the contents of the cloned repository. You should see the following files and sub-directories.\\n\\n├── getting-started-app/\\n│ ├── .dockerignore\\n│ ├── package.json\\n│ ├── README.md\\n│ ├── spec/\\n│ ├── src/\\n│ └── yarn.lockBuild the app\\'s imageTo build the image, you\\'ll need to use a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is simply a text-based file with no file extension that contains a script of instructions. Docker uses this script to build a container image.In the getting-started-app directory, the same location as the\\npackage.json file, create a file named Dockerfile with the following contents:\\n\\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\\n\\nFROM node:lts-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN yarn install --production\\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/index.js\"]\\nEXPOSE 3000This Dockerfile starts off with a node:lts-alpine base image, a\\nlight-weight Linux image that comes with Node.js and the Yarn package\\nmanager pre-installed. It copies all of the source code into the image,\\ninstalls the necessary dependencies, and starts the application.Build the image using the following commands:In the terminal, make sure you\\'re in the getting-started-app directory. Replace /path/to/getting-started-app with the path to your getting-started-app directory.\\n\\n$ cd /path/to/getting-started-app\\nBuild the image.\\n\\n$ docker build -t getting-started .\\nThe docker build command uses the Dockerfile to build a new image. You might have noticed that Docker downloaded a lot of \"layers\". This is because you instructed the builder that you wanted to start from the node:lts-alpine image. But, since you didn\\'t have that on your machine, Docker needed to download the image.After Docker downloaded the image, the instructions from the Dockerfile copied in your application and used yarn to install your application\\'s dependencies. The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.Finally, the -t flag tags your image. Think of this as a human-readable name for the final image. Since you named the image getting-started, you can refer to that image when you run a container.The . at the end of the docker build command tells Docker that it should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.Start an app containerNow that you have an image, you can run the application in a container using the docker run command.Run your container using the docker run command and specify the name of the image you just created:\\n\\n$ docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started\\nThe -d flag (short for --detach) runs the container in the background.\\nThis means that Docker starts your container and returns you to the terminal\\nprompt. Also, it does not display logs in the terminal.The -p flag (short for --publish) creates a port mapping between the\\nhost and the container. The -p flag takes a string value in the format of\\nHOST:CONTAINER, where HOST is the address on the host, and CONTAINER\\nis the port on the container. The command publishes the container\\'s port\\n3000 to 127.0.0.1:3000 (localhost:3000) on the host. Without the port\\nmapping, you wouldn\\'t be able to access the application from the host.After a few seconds, open your web browser to\\nhttp://localhost:3000.\\nYou should see your app.\\nAdd an item or two and see that it works as you expect. You can mark items as complete and remove them. Your frontend is successfully storing items in the backend.At this point, you have a running todo list manager with a few items.If you take a quick look at your containers, you should see at least one container running that\\'s using the getting-started image and on port 3000. To see your containers, you can use the CLI or Docker Desktop\\'s graphical interface.\\nCLI\\n\\n\\nDocker DesktopRun the docker ps command in a terminal to list your containers.\\n\\n$ docker ps\\nOutput similar to the following should appear.\\n\\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES\\ndf784548666d        getting-started     \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        127.0.0.1:3000->3000/tcp   priceless_mcclintock\\nIn Docker Desktop, select the Containers tab to see a list of your containers.\\nSummaryIn this section, you learned the basics about creating a Dockerfile to build an image. Once you built an image, you started a container and saw the running app.Related information:Dockerfile referencedocker CLI referenceNext stepsNext, you\\'re going to make a modification to your app and learn how to update your running application with a new image.

In this part, you\\'ll update the application and image. You\\'ll also learn how to stop and remove a container.Update the source codeIn the following steps, you\\'ll change the \"empty text\" when you don\\'t have any todo list items to \"You have no todo items yet! Add one above!\"In the src/static/js/app.js file, update line 56 to use the new empty text.\\n\\n- <p className=\"text-center\">No items yet!

The reason is that the old container is already using the host\\'s port 3000 and only one process on the machine (containers included) can listen to a specific port. To fix this, you need to remove the old container.Remove the old containerTo remove a container, you first need to stop it. Once it has stopped, you can remove it. You can remove the old container using the CLI or Docker Desktop\\'s graphical interface. Choose the option that you\\'re most comfortable with.\\nCLI\\n\\n\\nDocker DesktopRemove a container using the CLIGet the ID of the container by using the docker ps command.\\n\\n$ docker ps\\nUse the docker stop command to stop the container.

To share Docker images, you have to use a Docker\\nregistry. The default registry is Docker Hub and is where all of the images you\\'ve used have come from.Docker IDA Docker ID lets you access Docker Hub, which is the world\\'s largest library and community for container images. Create a\\nDocker ID for free if you don\\'t have one.Create a repositoryTo push an image, you first need to create a repository on Docker Hub.Sign up or Sign in to\\nDocker Hub.Select the Create Repository button.For the repository name, use getting-started. Make sure the Visibility is Public.Select Create.In the following image, you can see an example Docker command from Docker Hub. This command will push to this repository.\\nPush the imageIn the command line, run the docker push command that you see on Docker\\nHub. Note that your command will have your Docker ID, not \"docker\". For example, docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started.\\n\\n$ docker push docker/getting-started\\nThe push refers to repository [docker.io/docker/getting-started]\\nAn image does not exist locally with the tag: docker/getting-started\\nWhy did it fail? The push command was looking for an image named docker/getting-started, but\\ndidn\\'t find one. If you run docker image ls, you won\\'t see one either.To fix this, you need to tag your existing image you\\'ve built to give it another name.Sign in to Docker Hub using the command docker login -u YOUR-USER-NAME.Use the docker tag command to give the getting-started image a new name. Replace YOUR-USER-NAME with your Docker ID.\\n\\n$ docker tag getting-started YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started\\nNow run the docker push command again. If you\\'re copying the value from\\nDocker Hub, you can drop the tagname part, as you didn\\'t add a tag to the\\nimage name. If you don\\'t specify a tag, Docker uses a tag called latest.\\n\\n$ docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started\\nRun the image on a new instanceNow that your image has been built and pushed into a registry, try running your app on a brand\\nnew instance that has never seen this container image. To do this, you will use Play with Docker.\\nNotePlay with Docker uses the amd64 platform. If you are using an ARM based Mac with Apple silicon, you will need to rebuild the image to be compatible with Play with Docker and push the new image to your repository.To build an image for the amd64 platform, use the --platform flag.\\n\\n$ docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started .\\nDocker buildx also supports building multi-platform images. To learn more, see\\nMulti-platform images.Open your browser to\\nPlay with Docker.Select Login and then select docker from the drop-down list.Sign in with your Docker Hub account and then select Start.Select the ADD NEW INSTANCE option on the left side bar. If you don\\'t see it, make your browser a little wider. After a few seconds, a terminal window opens in your browser.\\nIn the terminal, start your freshly pushed app.\\n\\n$ docker run -dp 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started\\nYou should see the image get pulled down and eventually start up.\\nTipYou may have noticed that this command binds the port mapping to a\\ndifferent IP address. Previous docker run commands published ports to\\n127.0.0.1:3000 on the host. This time, you\\'re using 0.0.0.0.Binding to 127.0.0.1 only exposes a container\\'s ports to the loopback\\ninterface. Binding to 0.0.0.0, however, exposes the container\\'s port\\non all interfaces of the host, making it available to the outside world.For more information about how port mapping works, see\\nNetworking.Select the 3000 badge when it appears.If the 3000 badge doesn\\'t appear, you can select Open Port and specify 3000.SummaryIn this section, you learned how to share your images by pushing them to a\\nregistry. You then went to a brand new instance and were able to run the freshly\\npushed image. This is quite common in CI pipelines, where the pipeline will\\ncreate the image and push it to a registry and then the production environment\\ncan use the latest version of the image.Related information:docker CLI referenceMulti-platform imagesDocker Hub overviewNext stepsIn the next section, you\\'ll learn how to persist data in your containerized application.Persist the DBPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsCreate a repositoryPush the imageRun the image on a new instanceSummaryNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/05_persisting_data/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker workshop\\n/\\nPart 4: Persist the DBPersist the DBTable of contentsThe container\\'s filesystemSee this in practiceContainer volumesPersist the todo dataCreate a volume and start the containerVerify that the data persistsDive into the volumeSummaryNext stepsIn case you didn\\'t notice, your todo list is empty every single time\\nyou launch the container. Why is this? In this part, you\\'ll dive into how the container is working.The container\\'s filesystemWhen a container runs, it uses the various layers from an image for its filesystem.\\nEach container also gets its own \"scratch space\" to create/update/remove files. Any\\nchanges won\\'t be seen in another container, even if they\\'re using the same image.See this in practiceTo see this in action, you\\'re going to start two containers. In one container,\\nyou\\'ll create a file. In the other container, you\\'ll check whether that same\\nfile exists.Start an Alpine container and create a new file in it.\\n\\n$ docker run --rm alpine touch greeting.txt\\n\\nTipAny commands you specify after the image name (in this case, alpine)\\nare executed inside the container. In this case, the command touch greeting.txt puts a file named greeting.txt on the container\\'s filesystem.Run a new Alpine container and use the stat command to check whether the file exists.\\n\\n$ docker run --rm alpine stat greeting.txt\\nYou should see output similar to the following that indicates the file does not exist in the new container.\\n\\nstat: can\\'t stat \\'greeting.txt\\': No such file or directory\\nThe greeting.txt file created by the first container did not exist in the\\nsecond container. That is because the writeable \"top layer\" of each container\\nis isolated. Even though both containers shared the same underlying layers that\\nmake up the base image, the writable layer is unique to each container.Container volumesWith the previous experiment, you saw that each container starts from the image definition each time it starts.\\nWhile containers can create, update, and delete files, those changes are lost when you remove the container\\nand Docker isolates all changes to that container. With volumes, you can change all of this.Volumes provide the ability to connect specific filesystem paths of\\nthe container back to the host machine. If you mount a directory in the container, changes in that\\ndirectory are also seen on the host machine. If you mount that same directory across container restarts, you\\'d see\\nthe same files.There are two main types of volumes. You\\'ll eventually use both, but you\\'ll start with volume mounts.Persist the todo dataBy default, the todo app stores its data in a SQLite database at\\n/etc/todos/todo.db in the container\\'s filesystem. If you\\'re not familiar with SQLite, no worries! It\\'s simply a relational database that stores all the data in a single file. While this isn\\'t the best for large-scale applications,\\nit works for small demos. You\\'ll learn how to switch this to a different database engine later.With the database being a single file, if you can persist that file on the host and make it available to the\\nnext container, it should be able to pick up where the last one left off. By creating a volume and attaching\\n(often called \"mounting\") it to the directory where you stored the data, you can persist the data. As your container\\nwrites to the todo.db file, it will persist the data to the host in the volume.As mentioned, you\\'re going to use a volume mount. Think of a volume mount as an opaque bucket of data.\\nDocker fully manages the volume, including the storage location on disk.

A volume mount is a great choice when you need somewhere\\npersistent to store your application data.A bind mount is another type of mount, which lets you share a directory from the\\nhost\\'s filesystem into the container. When working on an application, you can\\nuse a bind mount to mount source code into the container. The container sees the\\nchanges you make to the code immediately, as soon as you save a file. This means\\nthat you can run processes in the container that watch for filesystem changes\\nand respond to them.In this chapter, you\\'ll see how you can use bind mounts and a tool called\\nnodemon to watch for file changes, and then restart the application\\nautomatically. There are equivalent tools in most other languages and\\nframeworks.Quick volume type comparisonsThe following are examples of a named volume and a bind mount using --mount:Named volume: type=volume,src=my-volume,target=/usr/local/dataBind mount: type=bind,src=/path/to/data,target=/usr/local/dataThe following table outlines the main differences between volume mounts and bind\\nmounts.Named volumesBind mountsHost locationDocker choosesYou decidePopulates new volume with container contentsYesNoSupports Volume DriversYesNoTrying out bind mountsBefore looking at how you can use bind mounts for developing your application,\\nyou can run a quick experiment to get a practical understanding of how bind mounts\\nwork.Verify that your getting-started-app directory is in a directory defined in\\nDocker Desktop\\'s file sharing setting. This setting defines which parts of your\\nfilesystem you can share with containers. For details about accessing the setting, see\\nFile sharing.\\nNoteThe File sharing tab is only available in Hyper-V mode, because the files are automatically shared in WSL 2 mode and Windows container mode.Open a terminal and change directory to the getting-started-app\\ndirectory.Run the following command to start bash in an ubuntu container with a\\nbind mount.\\nMac / Linux\\n\\n\\nCommand Prompt\\n\\n\\nGit Bash\\n\\n\\nPowerShell\\n\\n$ docker run -it --mount type=bind,src=\"$(pwd)\",target=/src ubuntu bash\\n\\n\\n$ docker run -it --mount \"type=bind,src=%cd%,target=/src\" ubuntu bash\\n\\n\\n$ docker run -it --mount type=bind,src=\"/$(pwd)\",target=/src ubuntu bash\\n\\n\\n$ docker run -it --mount \"type=bind,src=$($pwd),target=/src\" ubuntu bash\\nThe --mount type=bind option tells Docker to create a bind mount, where src is the\\ncurrent working directory on your host machine (getting-started-app), and\\ntarget is where that directory should appear inside the container (/src).After running the command, Docker starts an interactive bash session in the\\nroot directory of the container\\'s filesystem.\\n\\nroot@ac1237fad8db:/# pwd\\n/\\nroot@ac1237fad8db:/# ls\\nbin   dev  home  media  opt   root  sbin  srv  tmp  var\\nboot  etc  lib   mnt    proc  run   src   sys  usr\\nChange directory to the src directory.This is the directory that you mounted when starting the container.

This procedure\\ndemonstrated how files are shared between the host and the container, and how\\nchanges are immediately reflected on both sides. Now you can use\\nbind mounts to develop software.Development containersUsing bind mounts is common for local development setups. The advantage is that the development machine doesn’t need to have all of the build tools and environments installed. With a single docker run command, Docker pulls dependencies and tools.Run your app in a development containerThe following steps describe how to run a development container with a bind\\nmount that does the following:Mount your source code into the containerInstall all dependenciesStart nodemon to watch for filesystem changesYou can use the CLI or Docker Desktop to run your container with a bind mount.\\nMac / Linux CLI\\n\\n\\nPowerShell CLI\\n\\n\\nCommand Prompt CLI\\n\\n\\nGit Bash CLI\\n\\n\\nDocker DesktopMake sure you don\\'t have any getting-started containers currently running.Run the following command from the getting-started-app directory.\\n\\n$ docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \\\\\\n    -w /app --mount type=bind,src=\"$(pwd)\",target=/app \\\\\\n    node:18-alpine \\\\\\n    sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"\\nThe following is a breakdown of the command:-dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 - same as before.

For\\nsimplicity, you\\'ll keep using a relational database and switch your application\\nto use MySQL. But, how should you run MySQL? How do you allow the containers to\\ntalk to each other?

But, now you will add MySQL to the\\napplication stack. The following question often arises - \"Where will MySQL run? Install it in the same\\ncontainer or run it separately?\" In general, each container should do one thing and do it well. The following are a few reasons to run the container separately:There\\'s a good chance you\\'d have to scale APIs and front-ends differently than databases.Separate containers let you version and update versions in isolation.While you may use a container for the database locally, you may want to use a managed service\\nfor the database in production. You don\\'t want to ship your database engine with your app then.Running multiple processes will require a process manager (the container only starts one process), which adds complexity to container startup/shutdown.And there are more reasons. So, like the following diagram, it\\'s best to run your app in multiple containers.\\nContainer networkingRemember that containers, by default, run in isolation and don\\'t know anything about other processes\\nor containers on the same machine. So, how do you allow one container to talk to another? The answer is\\nnetworking. If you place the two containers on the same network, they can talk to each other.Start MySQLThere are two ways to put a container on a network:Assign the network when starting the container.Connect an already running container to a network.In the following steps, you\\'ll create the network first and then attach the MySQL container at startup.Create the network.\\n\\n$ docker network create todo-app\\nStart a MySQL container and attach it to the network. You\\'re also going to define a few environment variables that the\\ndatabase will use to initialize the database. To learn more about the MySQL environment variables, see the \"Environment Variables\" section in the\\nMySQL Docker Hub listing.\\nMac / Linux / Git Bash\\n\\n\\nPowerShell\\n\\n\\nCommand Prompt\\n\\n$ docker run -d \\\\\\n    --network todo-app --network-alias mysql \\\\\\n    -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \\\\\\n    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \\\\\\n    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos \\\\\\n    mysql:8.0\\n\\n\\n$ docker run -d `\\n    --network todo-app --network-alias mysql `\\n    -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql `\\n    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret `\\n    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos `\\n    mysql:8.0\\n\\n$ docker run -d ^\\n    --network todo-app --network-alias mysql ^\\n    -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql ^\\n    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret ^\\n    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos ^\\n    mysql:8.0\\nIn the previous command, you can see the --network-alias flag. In a later section, you\\'ll learn more about this flag.\\nTipYou\\'ll notice a volume named todo-mysql-data in the above command that is mounted at /var/lib/mysql, which is where MySQL stores its data. However, you never ran a docker volume create command. Docker recognizes you want to use a named volume and creates one automatically for you.To confirm you have the database up and running, connect to the database and verify that it connects.\\n\\n$ docker exec -it <mysql-container-id> mysql -u root -p\\nWhen the password prompt comes up, type in secret. In the MySQL shell, list the databases and verify\\nyou see the todos database.\\n\\nmysql> SHOW DATABASES;\\nYou should see output that looks like this:\\n\\n+--------------------+\\n| Database           |\\n+--------------------+\\n| information_schema |\\n| mysql              |\\n| performance_schema |\\n| sys                |\\n| todos              |\\n+--------------------+\\n5 rows in set (0.00 sec)Exit the MySQL shell to return to the shell on your machine.\\n\\nmysql> exit\\nYou now have a todos database and it\\'s ready for you to use.Connect to MySQLNow that you know MySQL is up and running, you can use it. But, how do you use it? If you run\\nanother container on the same network, how do you find the container? Remember that each container has its own IP address.To answer the questions above and better understand container networking, you\\'re going to make use of the\\nnicolaka/netshoot container,\\nwhich ships with a lot of tools that are useful for troubleshooting or debugging networking issues.Start a new container using the nicolaka/netshoot image. Make sure to connect it to the same network.\\n\\n$ docker run -it --network todo-app nicolaka/netshoot\\nInside the container, you\\'re going to use the dig command, which is a useful DNS tool. You\\'re going to look up\\nthe IP address for the hostname mysql.\\n\\n$ dig mysql\\nYou should get output like the following.\\n\\n; <<>> DiG 9.18.8 <<>> mysql\\n;; global options: +cmd\\n;; Got answer:\\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 32162\\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\\n\\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\\n;mysql.\\t\\t\\t\\tIN\\tA\\n\\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\\nmysql.\\t\\t\\t600\\tIN\\tA\\t172.23.0.2\\n\\n;; Query time: 0 msec\\n;; SERVER: 127.0.0.11#53(127.0.0.11)\\n;; WHEN: Tue Oct 01 23:47:24 UTC 2019\\n;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 44In the \"ANSWER SECTION\", you will see an A record for mysql that resolves to 172.23.0.2\\n(your IP address will most likely have a different value). While mysql isn\\'t normally a valid hostname,\\nDocker was able to resolve it to the IP address of the container that had that network alias. Remember, you used the\\n--network-alias earlier.What this means is that your app only simply needs to connect to a host named mysql and it\\'ll talk to the\\ndatabase.Run your app with MySQLThe todo app supports the setting of a few environment variables to specify MySQL connection settings. They are:MYSQL_HOST - the hostname for the running MySQL serverMYSQL_USER - the username to use for the connectionMYSQL_PASSWORD - the password to use for the connectionMYSQL_DB - the database to use once connected\\nNoteWhile using env vars to set connection settings is generally accepted for development, it\\'s highly discouraged\\nwhen running applications in production. Diogo Monica, a former lead of security at Docker,\\nwrote a fantastic blog post\\nexplaining why.A more secure mechanism is to use the secret support provided by your container orchestration framework. In most cases,\\nthese secrets are mounted as files in the running container. You\\'ll see many apps (including the MySQL image and the todo app)\\nalso support env vars with a _FILE suffix to point to a file containing the variable.As an example, setting the MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE var will cause the app to use the contents of the referenced file\\nas the connection password. Docker doesn\\'t do anything to support these env vars. Your app will need to know to look for\\nthe variable and get the file contents.You can now start your dev-ready container.Specify each of the previous environment variables, as well as connect the container to your app network.

You learned a little bit about container networking and service discovery using DNS.Related information:docker CLI referenceNetworking overviewNext stepsThere\\'s a good chance you are starting to feel a little overwhelmed with everything you need to do to start up\\nthis application. You have to create a network, start containers, specify all of the environment variables, expose\\nports, and more. That\\'s a lot to remember and it\\'s certainly making things harder to pass along to someone else.In the next section, you\\'ll learn about Docker Compose. With Docker Compose, you can share your application stacks in a\\nmuch easier way and let others spin them up with a single, simple command.Use Docker ComposePage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsContainer networkingStart MySQLConnect to MySQLRun your app with MySQLSummaryNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/08_using_compose/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker workshop\\n/\\nPart 7: Use Docker ComposeUse Docker ComposeTable of contentsCreate the Compose fileDefine the app serviceDefine the MySQL serviceRun the application stackSee the app stack in Docker Desktop DashboardTear it all downSummaryNext stepsDocker Compose is a tool that helps you define and\\nshare multi-container applications. With Compose, you can create a YAML file to define the services\\nand with a single command, you can spin everything up or tear it all down.The big advantage of using Compose is you can define your application stack in a file, keep it at the root of\\nyour project repository (it\\'s now version controlled), and easily enable someone else to contribute to your project.\\nSomeone would only need to clone your repository and start the app using Compose. In fact, you might see quite a few projects\\non GitHub/GitLab doing exactly this now.Create the Compose fileIn the getting-started-app directory, create a file named compose.yaml.\\n\\n├── getting-started-app/\\n│ ├── Dockerfile\\n│ ├── compose.yaml\\n│ ├── node_modules/\\n│ ├── package.json\\n│ ├── spec/\\n│ ├── src/\\n│ └── yarn.lockDefine the app serviceIn\\npart 6, you used the following command to start the application service.\\n\\n$ docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \\\\\\n  -w /app -v \"$(pwd):/app\" \\\\\\n  --network todo-app \\\\\\n  -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql \\\\\\n  -e MYSQL_USER=root \\\\\\n  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret \\\\\\n  -e MYSQL_DB=todos \\\\\\n  node:18-alpine \\\\\\n  sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"\\nYou\\'ll now define this service in the compose.yaml file.Open compose.yaml in a text or code editor, and start by defining the name and image of the first service (or container) you want to run as part of your application.\\nThe name will automatically become a network alias, which will be useful when defining your MySQL service.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: node:18-alpineTypically, you will see command close to the image definition, although there is no requirement on ordering. Add the command to your compose.yaml file.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: node:18-alpine\\n    command: sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"Now migrate the -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 part of the command by defining the ports for the service.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: node:18-alpine\\n    command: sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"\\n    ports:\\n      - 127.0.0.1:3000:3000Next, migrate both the working directory (-w /app) and the volume mapping\\n(-v \"$(pwd):/app\") by using the working_dir and volumes definitions.One advantage of Docker Compose volume definitions is you can use relative paths from the current directory.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: node:18-alpine\\n    command: sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"\\n    ports:\\n      - 127.0.0.1:3000:3000\\n    working_dir: /app\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./:/appFinally, you need to migrate the environment variable definitions using the environment key.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: node:18-alpine\\n    command: sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"\\n    ports:\\n      - 127.0.0.1:3000:3000\\n    working_dir: /app\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./:/app\\n    environment:\\n      MYSQL_HOST: mysql\\n      MYSQL_USER: root\\n      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret\\n      MYSQL_DB: todosDefine the MySQL serviceNow, it\\'s time to define the MySQL service. The command that you used for that container was the following:\\n\\n$ docker run -d \\\\\\n  --network todo-app --network-alias mysql \\\\\\n  -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \\\\\\n  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \\\\\\n  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos \\\\\\n  mysql:8.0\\nFirst define the new service and name it mysql so it automatically gets the network alias. Also specify the image to use as well.\\n\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    # The app service definition\\n  mysql:\\n    image: mysql:8.0Next, define the volume mapping. When you ran the container with docker run, Docker created the named volume automatically. However, that doesn\\'t\\nhappen when running with Compose. You need to define the volume in the\\ntop-level volumes: section and then specify the mountpoint in the service\\nconfig. By simply providing only the volume name, the default options are\\nused.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    # The app service definition\\n  mysql:\\n    image: mysql:8.0\\n    volumes:\\n      - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql\\n\\nvolumes:\\n  todo-mysql-data:Finally, you need to specify the environment variables.\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    # The app service definition\\n  mysql:\\n    image: mysql:8.0\\n    volumes:\\n      - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql\\n    environment:\\n      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret\\n      MYSQL_DATABASE: todos\\n\\nvolumes:\\n  todo-mysql-data:At this point, your complete compose.yaml should look like this:\\n\\nservices:\\n  app:\\n    image: node:18-alpine\\n    command: sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\"\\n    ports:\\n      - 127.0.0.1:3000:3000\\n    working_dir: /app\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./:/app\\n    environment:\\n      MYSQL_HOST: mysql\\n      MYSQL_USER: root\\n      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret\\n      MYSQL_DB: todos\\n\\n  mysql:\\n    image: mysql:8.0\\n    volumes:\\n      - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql\\n    environment:\\n      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret\\n      MYSQL_DATABASE: todos\\n\\nvolumes:\\n  todo-mysql-data:Run the application stackNow that you have your compose.yaml file, you can start your application.Make sure no other copies of the containers are running first. Use docker ps to list the containers and docker rm -f <ids> to remove them.Start up the application stack using the docker compose up command. Add the\\n-d flag to run everything in the background.\\n\\n$ docker compose up -d\\nWhen you run the previous command, you should see output like the following:\\n\\nCreating network \"app_default\" with the default driver\\nCreating volume \"app_todo-mysql-data\" with default driver\\nCreating app_app_1   ... done\\nCreating app_mysql_1 ... doneYou\\'ll notice that Docker Compose created the volume as well as a network. By default, Docker Compose automatically creates a network specifically for the application stack (which is why you didn\\'t define one in the Compose file).Look at the logs using the docker compose logs -f command. You\\'ll see the logs from each of the services interleaved\\ninto a single stream. This is incredibly useful when you want to watch for timing-related issues. The -f flag follows the\\nlog, so will give you live output as it\\'s generated.If you have run the command already, you\\'ll see output that looks like this:\\n\\nmysql_1  | 2019-10-03T03:07:16.083639Z 0 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.\\nmysql_1  | Version: \\'8.0.31\\'  socket: \\'/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\\'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server (GPL)\\napp_1    | Connected to mysql db at host mysql\\napp_1    | Listening on port 3000The service name is displayed at the beginning of the line (often colored) to help distinguish messages. If you want to\\nview the logs for a specific service, you can add the service name to the end of the logs command (for example,\\ndocker compose logs -f app).At this point, you should be able to open your app in your browser on\\nhttp://localhost:3000 and see it running.See the app stack in Docker Desktop DashboardIf you look at the Docker Desktop Dashboard, you\\'ll see that there is a group named getting-started-app. This is the project name from Docker\\nCompose and used to group the containers together. By default, the project name is simply the name of the directory that the\\ncompose.yaml was located in.If you expand the stack, you\\'ll see the two containers you defined in the Compose file. The names are also a little\\nmore descriptive, as they follow the pattern of <service-name>-<replica-number>. So, it\\'s very easy to\\nquickly see what container is your app and which container is the mysql database.Tear it all downWhen you\\'re ready to tear it all down, simply run docker compose down or hit the trash can on the Docker Desktop Dashboard\\nfor the entire app. The containers will stop and the network will be removed.\\nWarningBy default, named volumes in your compose file are not removed when you run docker compose down. If you want to\\nremove the volumes, you need to add the --volumes flag.The Docker Desktop Dashboard does not remove volumes when you delete the app stack.SummaryIn this section, you learned about Docker Compose and how it helps you simplify\\nthe way you define and share multi-service applications.Related information:Compose overviewCompose file referenceCompose CLI referenceNext stepsNext, you\\'ll learn about a few best practices you can use to improve your Dockerfile.Image-building best practicesPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsCreate the Compose fileDefine the app serviceDefine the MySQL serviceRun the application stackSee the app stack in Docker Desktop DashboardTear it all downSummaryNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/09_image_best/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker workshop\\n/\\nPart 8: Image-building best practicesImage-building best practicesTable of contentsImage layeringLayer cachingMulti-stage buildsMaven/Tomcat exampleReact exampleSummaryNext stepsImage layeringUsing the docker image history command, you can see the command that was used\\nto create each layer within an image.Use the docker image history command to see the layers in the getting-started image you\\ncreated.\\n\\n$ docker image history getting-started\\nYou should get output that looks something like the following.\\n\\nIMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE                COMMENT\\na78a40cbf866        18 seconds ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD [\"node\" \"src/index.j…    0B                  \\nf1d1808565d6        19 seconds ago      /bin/sh -c yarn install --production            85.4MB              \\na2c054d14948        36 seconds ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop) COPY dir:5dc710ad87c789593…   198kB               \\n9577ae713121        37 seconds ago      /bin/sh -c #(nop) WORKDIR /app                  0B                  \\nb95baba1cfdb        13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD [\"node\"]                 0B                  \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENTRYPOINT [\"docker-entry…   0B                  \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) COPY file:238737301d473041…   116B                \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c apk add --no-cache --virtual .bui…   5.35MB              \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENV YARN_VERSION=1.21.1      0B                  \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c addgroup -g 1000 node     && addu…   74.3MB              \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENV NODE_VERSION=12.14.1     0B                  \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD [\"/bin/sh\"]              0B                  \\n<missing>           13 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:e69d441d729412d24…   5.59MB   Each of the lines represents a layer in the image. The display here shows the base at the bottom with\\nthe newest layer at the top. Using this, you can also quickly see the size of each layer, helping\\ndiagnose large images.You\\'ll notice that several of the lines are truncated. If you add the --no-trunc flag, you\\'ll get the\\nfull output.\\n\\n$ docker image history --no-trunc getting-started\\nLayer cachingNow that you\\'ve seen the layering in action, there\\'s an important lesson to learn to help decrease build\\ntimes for your container images. Once a layer changes, all downstream layers have to be recreated as well.Look at the following Dockerfile you created for the getting started app.\\n\\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\\nFROM node:lts-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN yarn install --production\\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/index.js\"]Going back to the image history output, you see that each command in the Dockerfile becomes a new layer in the image.\\nYou might remember that when you made a change to the image, the yarn dependencies had to be reinstalled. It doesn\\'t make much sense to ship around the same dependencies every time you build.To fix it, you need to restructure your Dockerfile to help support the caching\\nof the dependencies. For Node-based applications, those dependencies are defined\\nin the package.json file. You can copy only that file in first, install the\\ndependencies, and then copy in everything else. Then, you only recreate the yarn\\ndependencies if there was a change to the package.json.Update the Dockerfile to copy in the package.json first, install dependencies, and then copy everything else in.\\n\\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\\nFROM node:lts-alpine\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY package.json yarn.lock ./\\nRUN yarn install --production\\nCOPY . .\\nCMD [\"node\", \"src/index.js\"]Build a new image using docker build.\\n\\n$ docker build -t getting-started .\\nYou should see output like the following.\\n\\n[+] Building 16.1s (10/10) FINISHED\\n=> [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile\\n=> => transferring dockerfile: 175B\\n=> [internal] load .dockerignore\\n=> => transferring context: 2B\\n=> [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:lts-alpine\\n=> [internal] load build context\\n=> => transferring context: 53.37MB\\n=> [1/5] FROM docker.io/library/node:lts-alpine\\n=> CACHED [2/5] WORKDIR /app\\n=> [3/5] COPY package.json yarn.lock ./\\n=> [4/5] RUN yarn install --production\\n=> [5/5] COPY . .\\n=> exporting to image\\n=> => exporting layers\\n=> => writing image     sha256:d6f819013566c54c50124ed94d5e66c452325327217f4f04399b45f94e37d25\\n=> => naming to docker.io/library/getting-startedNow, make a change to the src/static/index.html file. For example, change the <title> to \"The Awesome Todo App\".Build the Docker image now using docker build -t getting-started . again. This time, your output should look a little different.\\n\\n[+] Building 1.2s (10/10) FINISHED\\n=> [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile\\n=> => transferring dockerfile: 37B\\n=> [internal] load .dockerignore\\n=> => transferring context: 2B\\n=> [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:lts-alpine\\n=> [internal] load build context\\n=> => transferring context: 450.43kB\\n=> [1/5] FROM docker.io/library/node:lts-alpine\\n=> CACHED [2/5] WORKDIR /app\\n=> CACHED [3/5] COPY package.json yarn.lock ./\\n=> CACHED [4/5] RUN yarn install --production\\n=> [5/5] COPY . .\\n=> exporting to image\\n=> => exporting layers\\n=> => writing image     sha256:91790c87bcb096a83c2bd4eb512bc8b134c757cda0bdee4038187f98148e2eda\\n=> => naming to docker.io/library/getting-startedFirst off, you should notice that the build was much faster. And, you\\'ll see\\nthat several steps are using previously cached layers. Pushing and pulling\\nthis image and updates to it will be much faster as well.Multi-stage buildsMulti-stage builds are an incredibly powerful\\ntool to help use multiple stages to create an image. There are several advantages for them:Separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependenciesReduce overall image size by shipping only what your app needs to runMaven/Tomcat exampleWhen building Java-based applications, you need a JDK to compile the source code to Java bytecode. However,\\nthat JDK isn\\'t needed in production. Also, you might be using tools like Maven or Gradle to help build the app.\\nThose also aren\\'t needed in your final image. Multi-stage builds help.\\n\\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\\nFROM maven AS build\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN mvn package\\n\\nFROM tomcat\\nCOPY --from=build /app/target/file.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps In this example, you use one stage (called build) to perform the actual Java build using Maven. In the second\\nstage (starting at FROM tomcat), you copy in files from the build stage. The final image is only the last stage\\nbeing created, which can be overridden using the --target flag.React exampleWhen building React applications, you need a Node environment to compile the JS code (typically JSX), SASS stylesheets,\\nand more into static HTML, JS, and CSS. If you aren\\'t doing server-side rendering, you don\\'t even need a Node environment\\nfor your production build. You can ship the static resources in a static nginx container.\\n\\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\\nFROM node:lts AS build\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY package* yarn.lock ./\\nRUN yarn install\\nCOPY public ./public\\nCOPY src ./src\\nRUN yarn run build\\n\\nFROM nginx:alpine\\nCOPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/htmlIn the previous Dockerfile example, it uses the node:lts image to perform the build (maximizing layer caching) and then copies the output\\ninto an nginx container.SummaryIn this section, you learned a few image building best practices, including layer caching and multi-stage builds.Related information:Dockerfile referenceDockerfile best practicesNext stepsIn the next section, you\\'ll learn about additional resources you can use to continue learning about containers.What nextPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsImage layeringLayer cachingMulti-stage buildsMaven/Tomcat exampleReact exampleSummaryNext steps'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/10_what_next/'}, page_content='Home\\n/\\nGet started\\n/\\nDocker workshop\\n/\\nPart 9: What nextWhat next after the Docker workshopTable of contentsContainer orchestrationCloud Native Computing Foundation projectsGetting started video workshopCreating a container from scratchAlthough you\\'re done with the workshop, there\\'s still a lot more to learn about containers.Here are a few other areas to look at next.Container orchestrationRunning containers in production is tough. You don\\'t want to log into a machine and simply run a\\ndocker run or docker compose up. Why not? Well, what happens if the containers die? How do you\\nscale across several machines? Container orchestration solves this problem. Tools like Kubernetes,\\nSwarm, Nomad, and ECS all help solve this problem, all in slightly different ways.The general idea is that you have managers who receive the expected state. This state might be\\n\"I want to run two instances of my web app and expose port 80.\" The managers then look at all of the\\nmachines in the cluster and delegate work to worker nodes. The managers watch for changes (such as\\na container quitting) and then work to make the actual state reflect the expected state.Cloud Native Computing Foundation projectsThe CNCF is a vendor-neutral home for various open-source projects, including Kubernetes, Prometheus,\\nEnvoy, Linkerd, NATS, and more. You can view the\\ngraduated and incubated projects here\\nand the entire\\nCNCF Landscape here. There are a lot of projects to help\\nsolve problems around monitoring, logging, security, image registries, messaging, and more.Getting started video workshopDocker recommends watching the video workshop from DockerCon 2022.

With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure\\nin the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's\\nmethodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can\\nsignificantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.The Docker platformDocker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated\\nenvironment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many\\ncontainers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain\\neverything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's\\ninstalled on the host. You can share containers while you work,\\nand be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the\\nsame way.Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment,\\nas a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your\\nproduction environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid\\nof the two.What can I use Docker for?Fast, consistent delivery of your applicationsDocker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in\\nstandardized environments using local containers which provide your applications\\nand services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous\\ndelivery (CI/CD) workflows.Consider the following example scenario:Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues\\nusing Docker containers.They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and run\\nautomated and manual tests.When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment\\nand redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as\\npushing the updated image to the production environment.Responsive deployment and scalingDocker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker\\ncontainers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual\\nmachines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically\\nmanage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as\\nbusiness needs dictate, in near real time.Running more workloads on the same hardwareDocker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative\\nto hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your server\\ncapacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density\\nenvironments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with\\nfewer resources.Docker architectureDocker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the\\nDocker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and\\ndistributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can\\nrun on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker\\ndaemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX\\nsockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose,\\nthat lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.\\nThe Docker daemonThe Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker\\nobjects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also\\ncommunicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.The Docker clientThe Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact\\nwith Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these\\ncommands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the\\nDocker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.Docker DesktopDocker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see\\nDocker Desktop.Docker registriesA Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public\\nregistry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on\\nDocker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, Docker pushes\\nyour image to your configured registry.Docker objectsWhen you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks,\\nvolumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some\\nof those objects.ImagesAn image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker\\ncontainer. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional\\ncustomization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu\\nimage, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the\\nconfiguration details needed to make your application run.You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others\\nand published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile\\nwith a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run\\nit. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you\\nchange the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have\\nchanged are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small,\\nand fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.ContainersA container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop,\\nmove, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a\\ncontainer to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new\\nimage based on its current state.By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and\\nits host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage,\\nor other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host\\nmachine.A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you\\nprovide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to\\nits state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear.Example docker run commandThe following command runs an ubuntu container, attaches interactively to your\\nlocal command-line session, and runs /bin/bash.\\n\\n$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash\\nWhen you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using\\nthe default registry configuration):If you don't have the ubuntu image locally, Docker pulls it from your\\nconfigured registry, as though you had run docker pull ubuntu manually.Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a docker container create\\ncommand manually.Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final\\nlayer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and\\ndirectories in its local filesystem.Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default\\nnetwork, since you didn't specify any networking options. This includes\\nassigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can\\nconnect to external networks using the host machine's network connection.Docker starts the container and executes /bin/bash. Because the container\\nis running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the -i and -t\\nflags), you can provide input using your keyboard while Docker logs the output to\\nyour terminal.When you run exit to terminate the /bin/bash command, the container\\nstops but isn't removed. You can start it again or remove it.The underlying technologyDocker is written in the\\nGo programming language and takes\\nadvantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality.\\nDocker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace\\ncalled the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of\\nnamespaces for that container.These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs\\nin a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.Next stepsInstall DockerGet started with DockerPage options\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy page as Markdown for LLMs\\n\\nView page as plain text\\n\\nAsk questions with Docs AI\\nEdit this page\\nRequest changesTable of contentsThe Docker platformWhat can I use Docker for?Fast, consistent delivery of your applicationsResponsive deployment and scalingRunning more workloads on the same hardwareDocker architectureThe Docker daemonThe Docker clientDocker DesktopDocker registriesDocker objectsThe underlying technologyNext steps\")]\n"

However, it does mention creating a base image using the `docker container commit` command, which allows you to create a new image from an existing container. It also mentions using a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains instructions for building an image.\\n\\nIn order to build an image in Docker, you would typically create a Dockerfile and then use the `docker build` command to build the image from the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile would contain instructions such as `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`, and `EXPOSE` that specify how to build the image.\\n\\nHere is an example of how you might build an image using a Dockerfile:\\n```\\nFROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\nCOPY requirements.txt .\\n\\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\nCOPY . .\\n\\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\\n```\\nThis Dockerfile creates an image based on the official Python 3.9 image, sets the working directory to `/app`, installs dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file, copies the application code into the image, and sets the default command to run the `app.py` file using Python.\\n\\nTo build the image, you would run the following command:\\n```\\ndocker build -t my-image .\\n```\\nThis would create a new image with the tag `my-image` and build the image from the instructions in the Dockerfile.'"
